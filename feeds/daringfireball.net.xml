<p>Sony, in a 2021 Instagram post, regarding the uniforms <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CT2STaKlJbM/?hl=en&amp;img_index=2">that so infatuated Steve Jobs</a> that he commissioned Miyake to design prototype vests for Apple employees to wear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The history of the relationship between the two companies dates
back to the 1980s. It was Issey Miyake whom Akio Morita, chairman
of the board at that time, requested for a uniform design which
employees take pride in with comfort year-round.</p>

<p>That’s the light nylon fabric uniform, created by the first
collaboration of Sony and ISSEY MIYAKE.</p>

<p>Featuring removable sleeves, it’s perfect for summer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a find it would be for someone to uncover one of Miyake’s prototype vests for Apple.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>From Walter Isaacson’s <em>Steve Jobs</em>, chapter 28, “CEO: Still Crazy After All These Years”, p. 361:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a trip to Japan in the early 1980s, Jobs asked Sony’s chairman,
Akio Morita, why everyone in his company’s factories wore
uniforms. “He looked very ashamed and told me that after the war,
no one had any clothes, and companies like Sony had to give their
workers something to wear each day,” Jobs recalled. Over the years
the uniforms developed their own signature style, especially at
companies such as Sony, and it became a way of bonding workers to
the company. “I decided that I wanted that type of bonding for
Apple,” Jobs recalled.</p>

<p>Sony, with its appreciation for style, had gotten the famous
designer Issey Miyake to create one of its uniforms. It was a
jacket made of ripstop nylon with sleeves that could unzip to make
it a vest. “So I called Issey and asked him to design a vest for
Apple,” Jobs recalled. “I came back with some samples and told
everyone it would be great if we would all wear these vests. Oh
man, did I get booed off the stage. Everybody hated the idea.”</p>

<p>In the process, however, he became friends with Miyake and would
visit him regularly. He also came to like the idea of having a
uniform for himself, because of both its daily convenience (the
rationale he claimed) and its ability to convey a signature style.
“So I asked Issey to make me some of his black turtlenecks that I
liked, and he made me like a hundred of them.” Jobs noticed my
surprise when he told this story, so he gestured to them stacked
up in the closet. “That’s what I wear,” he said. “I have enough to
last for the rest of my life.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2012/02/walter_isaacson_steve_jobs">my review of the book</a> noted, Isaacson’s biography is profoundly flawed, at times grossly factually wrong, when it comes to documenting Jobs’s work. But it’s still a valuable book overall, and a unique resource regarding the personal aspects of Jobs’s life. (Purchase links: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537/?tag=df-amzn-20">Amazon</a> (which somehow has the hardcover edition for just $12), <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/56320/9781982176860">Bookshop.org</a>, and <a href="https://books.apple.com/us/book/steve-jobs/id431617578">Apple Books</a>.)</p>

<p>Bonus excerpt, from chapter 20, “A Regular Guy: Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word”, regarding Jobs’s biological sister, the novelist <a href="https://www.monasimpson.com/">Mona Simpson</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the few things they would argue about was her clothes. She
dressed like a struggling novelist, and he would berate her for
not wearing clothes that were “fetching enough.” At one point his
comments so annoyed her that she wrote him a letter: “I am a young
writer, and this is my life, and I’m not trying to be a model
anyway.” He didn’t answer. But shortly after, a box arrived from
the store of Issey Miyake, the Japanese fashion designer whose
stark and technology-influenced style made him one of Jobs’s
favorites. “He’d gone shopping for me,” she later said, “and he’d
picked out great things, exactly my size, in flattering colors.”
There was one pantsuit that he had particularly liked, and the
shipment included three of them, all identical. “I still remember
those first suits I sent Mona,” he said. “They were linen pants
and tops in a pale grayish green that looked beautiful with her
reddish hair.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Issey Miyake, the man, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/aug/09/issey-miyake-famed-japanese-fashion-designer-dies-aged-84">died in 2022 at 84</a>.</p>

<p>Craig Grannell, writing for Stuff:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This collaboration with Issey Miyake was, we’re told, inspired by
the concept of “a piece of cloth”. The result of all that R&amp;D? A
crossbody sock. It’s as if someone raided a warehouse of iPod
Socks, stretched them out and fashioned them up.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwVymejFMpw">Steve Jobs introduced the originals</a>, he called them a
“revolutionary new product for iPod … socks”. Clearly enjoying
himself, he joked that case makers were making more money than
Apple did on the iPod, and so Apple thought it’d offer something
too. “And our design team came up with socks,” he said. You got
six colours for $29 — about $50 in today’s money — and they were
a warm expression of Apple’s playful side (and, as Jobs quipped,
would “keep your iPod warm on cold days”).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Jobs announced iPod Socks in 2004, a lot of people thought he was pulling a gag. Some people didn’t believe they were real <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2004/11/12/socks">until they went on sale</a>. My wife and I bought a pack and we both enjoyed them. (I took the gray one, natch.) It was a nice way to protect your iPod before throwing it in a bag, and getting six for $30 felt like a lark.</p>

<p>No one seems worried that iPhone Pocket is a gag. Make of that what you will.</p>

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ISSEY MIYAKE and Apple today unveiled iPhone Pocket. Inspired by
the concept of “a piece of cloth,” its singular 3D-knitted
construction is designed to fit any iPhone as well as all
pocketable items. [...]</p>

<p>Crafted in Japan, iPhone Pocket features a singular 3D-knitted
construction that is the result of research and development
carried out at ISSEY MIYAKE. The design drew inspiration from the
concept of “a piece of cloth” and reinterpreted the everyday
utility of the brand’s iconic pleated clothing. The development
and design of iPhone Pocket unfolded in close collaboration with
the Apple Design Studio, which provided insight into design and
production throughout.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t object to the price ($150 for the short strap, $230 for the long strap). I do object to Apple going along with <a href="https://us.isseymiyake.com/">Issey Miyake</a>’s preference to style their name in all-caps.</p>

<p>Patrick George, writing for The Atlantic under the ominous headline “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/11/apple-carplay-general-motors/684799/">Enjoy CarPlay While You Still Can</a>” (<a href="https://apple.news/ANxiNTajCQmehDZj5hCGR4A">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://insideevs.com/news/705467/ford-lincoln-apple-carplay-android/">Some automakers</a> have made a point of
<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/hyundai-carplay-android-auto-options/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">proclaiming their allegiance</a> to CarPlay, knowing that’s
what buyers want. Toyota’s EVs tell CarPlay <a href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/toyota-brings-apple-maps-ev-routing-to-its-newest-models-164103063.html">how much electric
range they have left</a>, so that Apple Maps can prompt the
driver to stop at a nearby charger on a road trip. But the
relationship between Detroit and Silicon Valley can be a tense
one. Apple sees tremendous value in expanding its presence in your
car: The next step is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/everything-we-learned-from-a-week-with-apple-carplay-ultra/">CarPlay Ultra</a>, which enables your
phone to control more of your car. Want to fiddle with the
temperature? Ask Siri to do it. It’s an Apple lover’s dream and a
car company’s worst nightmare. If that feature catches on,
companies will just be makers of rolling shells for tech
companies. One executive for the French automaker Renault was
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cdd7c98a-10a7-437c-a85a-68f7f9be2b0b">reportedly blunt</a> with Apple: “Don’t try to invade our own
system.” (Apple declined to comment.)</p>

<p>No matter what car you drive, the glory days of CarPlay may be
numbered. For the auto industry, there’s just too much money to be
made from creating their own versions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>George’s argument is that GM isn’t an outlier in abandoning CarPlay support, but rather a first mover, and most or all of the other major carmakers will follow. Not because they think they can make better software to provide a better experience than CarPlay offers, but because they’ll seek to gate all such features behind subscriptions.</p>

<p>I don’t doubt that most carmakers are looking at ways to charge subscriptions. I do doubt, however, that they’re going to follow GM’s lead in abandoning CarPlay support. It’s fundamentally a question of betting against the iPhone. That’s proven to be a bad bet, and my money says it’s going to prove to be a disastrous one for GM. There’s plenty of room to charge car buyers for subscription offerings while supporting CarPlay. To me, the most telling response to GM’s decision to abandon CarPlay support <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/05/ford-ceo-jim-farley-carplay">was from Ford CEO Jim Farley</a>, during an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/ford-ceo-on-apple-google-and-elon-musk/B6D8BC45-1C4A-45D3-97AC-933A57B76E31.html">on-stage interview with Joanna Stern in 2023</a>. He laughed. And after laughing, said, “The interior has to be really well done. But in terms of content? We kind of lost that battle 10 years ago. So get real with it, because you’re not going to make a ton of money on content inside the vehicle. It’s going to be safety/security, partial autonomy, and productivity in our eyes. [...] 70 percent of our Ford customers in the U.S. are Apple customers. Why would I go to an Apple customer and say ‘Good luck!’? That doesn’t seem customer centric.”</p>

<p>It’s worth pointing out that when talking about this, almost no one mentions Android Auto. GM is dropping support for that too, but no one cares. The iPhone is the phone for people who care about their phone, and thus, CarPlay is the only car-phone integration that really matters.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23156741/ios-16-carplay-apple-wwdc-hvac-deeper-integration">Back at WWDC 2022</a>, when they announced what is now CarPlay Ultra, Apple cited a survey claiming that 79 percent of new car buyers consider CarPlay support before making a purchase. Last year, <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2024/06/no-apple-carplay-or-android-auto-is-a-deal-breaker-for-one-third-of-car-buyers/">a McKinsey survey</a> showed that one-third of new car buyers simply would not buy a car without CarPlay/Android Auto support. And, if CarPlay were removed from their current cars, 52 percent of drivers would use their phone instead — not their car’s built-in entertainment system.</p>

<p>Automotive vehicles are an interesting market because no carmaker has even close to a monopoly. <a href="https://roadgenius.com/cars/statistics/sales-by-manufacturer/">The worldwide market</a> leader is Toyota, with 11 percent, followed by Volkswagen (6%), Honda (5%), Ford (5%), and Hyundai (5%). If CarPlay is as popular as it seems, market competition should not only keep it broadly supported, but I think will see it return to GM after CEO Mary Barra gets fired for the fiasco she’s steering the company toward.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I upgrade my iPhones and iPads to new iOS releases, including developer betas, pretty much willy-nilly. I’m more conservative about the Macs I use for work. For example, I rely on audio software from <a href="https://www.rogueamoeba.com/">Rogue Amoeba</a> for recording both The Talk Show and Dithering, and <a href="https://www.rogueamoeba.com/support/knowledgebase/?showArticle=Troubleshooting-MacOS-26-Tahoe">there were bugs in MacOS 26.0.0 and 26.0.1</a> that could have resulted in lost audio. Those bugs have been fixed as of MacOS 26.1, so, over the weekend, I upgraded the Mac I use for podcasting. But my main MacBook Pro is still running MacOS 15 Sequoia — not because of any compatibility issues, but simply because I think the Tahoe user interface is goofy looking. I’ll probably bite the bullet and upgrade when 26.2 comes out next month, but for now, I’m luxuriating with a MacOS UI with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/07/tahoes-terrible-icons">well-crafted app icons</a> and windows that don’t have <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/10/16/tahoe-window-corners/">Fisher-Price-style corner radiuses</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, though, I’m keeping MacOS 15 Sequoia up to date. When the MacOS 15.7.2 update arrived last week, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/115499153276833424">I noted in a post on Mastodon</a> that it sure looked like clicking the “Update Now” button next to the MacOS 15.7.2 update in System Settings → General → Software Update would actually install the upgrade to MacOS 26.1 Tahoe. There are little “ⓘ” buttons next to the “Upgrade” buttons for Tahoe 26.1 and “Update” buttons for Sequoia 15.7.2. The “Info” panel that’s presented after clicking <em>either</em> “ⓘ” button shows that Tahoe 26.1 is the version that is checked.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/11/other-updates-info-button.png" class="noborder">
  <img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/11/other-updates-info-button.png"
    alt = "Screenshot of MacOS 15.7.1 System Settings: General: Software Update, with an arrow pointing to the ⓘ info button."
    width = 500
  /></a></p>

<p>Click that “ⓘ” button in the “Other Updates” section and you get:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/11/other-updates-info-panel.png" class="noborder">
  <img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/11/other-updates-info-panel.png"
    alt = "Screenshot after clicking the ⓘ button, showing that the upgrade to Tahoe 26.1 is selected, not the available update to Sequoia 15.7.2."
    width = 500
  /></a></p>

<p>Leon Cowle was brave enough to try this out, and, <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@leoncowle/115499194488171450">it turns out</a>, just clicking the “Update Now” button next to Sequoia will, thankfully, do the right thing: install the Sequoia 15.7.2 update, not Tahoe. (I followed Cowle’s brave lead and tried it myself, and can confirm that “Update Now” installed the Sequoia 15.7.2 update.) Why the Info panel presented by clicking the “ⓘ” button <em>next to Sequoia</em> in the “Other Updates” section defaults to installing the upgrade to 26.1 Tahoe, I don’t know. But it sure makes it seem like we need to be more careful than we actually do if we want to stick with MacOS 15 Sequoia for now.</p>

<p>The “ⓘ” buttons do not, as I would expect, open a sheet with detailed information about the software updates <em>per</em> each section of the Software Update settings panel. Instead, even though there are separate “ⓘ”  buttons in each section of the settings panel, they each open the same sheet that allows exact control over which available software updates to install. That includes the exact same <em>default</em> selections in this sheet. But the items selected (checked) in this sheet have <em>no bearing</em> on what gets installed by the “Upgrade Now” and “Update Now” / ”Update Tonight” buttons in the main Software Update settings panel. Those checked items in the “ⓘ” sheet only control what gets installed from within that sheet itself. So if you click the “ⓘ” in the “Other Updates” section, because you want to update to the latest version of MacOS 15 Sequoia and see what other updates are being installed (like Safari, in my example screenshot above), and you don’t pay attention to the checked version of MacOS in that sheet, you can inadvertently upgrade to Tahoe.</p>

<p>I don’t know what the <em>i</em> in the “ⓘ” button is supposed to stand for, but it isn’t <em>intuitive</em>.</p>

<p>Jason Snell, writing at Macworld:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In that first event (which you can relive in the YouTube video
below), Apple announced its first wave of M1 Macs: the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/234819/macbook-air-m1-review-an-absolutely-stunning-debut-for-apple-silicon-in-a-mac.html">MacBook
Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/234838/13-inch-macbook-pro-m1-review-amazing-breakthroughs-in-processing-and-battery-performance.html">13-inch MacBook Pro,</a> and <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/234842/m1-mac-mini-review-the-mac-with-the-best-ever-bang-for-your-buck.html">Mac mini</a>. The
Macs themselves all used the same design as their Intel
predecessors, as Apple wrapped potentially scary new technology in
completely familiar shapes.</p>

<p>Then the results of the first M1 speed tests arrived, and nothing
felt scary anymore. Everything was fast, much faster than Intel,
so much faster that even software compiled for Intel running in a
code-translation layer via Rosetta ran just fine. In fact, the M1
was such a fast chip that, five years later, Apple’s still selling
the M1 MacBook Air. (For $599, at Walmart.) And it’s still a
pretty nice computer! [...]</p>

<p>The result of all of this is, though every generation has its
quirks, Apple has managed to not drop the ball after the
gigantic leap from Intel to M1. Every generation of M-series
processors has offered impressive speed boosts. Apple’s CPU
cores just get 10% to 30% faster every generation. The GPU cores
got faster in all but one generation–and in that generation,
overall graphics performance still got faster because the chips
all had more GPU cores.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These first five years of Apple Silicon Macs have been the best five-year-run for Mac hardware in the platform’s 41-year history. Hardware-wise, the Mac platform has never been in better shape. And there’s no sign of letup. I fully expect the next five years to be, if anything, even better than the last five — with MacBooks <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/07/low-cost-macbook-rumors-2026/">expanding to lower price points</a>, and Mac Pros, finally, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/04/mac-studio-m5-ultra-2026/">expanding the high end of personal supercomputing</a>.</p>

<p>Don Van Natta Jr. and Adam Schefter, reporting for ESPN:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Donald Trump wants the Washington Commanders to name
their planned $3.7 billion stadium after him, multiple sources
with knowledge of the situation told ESPN.</p>

<p>A senior White House source said there have been back-channel
communications with a member of the Commanders’ ownership group,
led by Josh Harris, to express Trump’s desire to have the domed
stadium in the nation’s capital bear his name. The new stadium is
being built on the old RFK Stadium site that served as the team’s
home from 1961 to 1996.</p>

<p>“That would be a beautiful name, as it was President Trump who
made the rebuilding of the new stadium possible,” White House
press secretary Karoline Leavitt told ESPN on Friday night via
email. Leavitt declined to answer additional questions, but the
senior White House source told ESPN: “It’s what the president
wants, and it will probably happen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Typically, venues like stadiums, airports, bridges, etc. aren’t named after political leaders until after they’ve died. Not so with mad kings rapidly descending into megalomaniacal dementia. This is crazy, pure and simple, just like <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-2db64cf0-41c6-42cd-a33b-92ab31593fe2">boogering up the White House</a> to make it <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91435635/new-white-house-signage">look like</a> a Las Vegas wedding chapel. Or — from just this morning — <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115520378078620283">retweeting</a> an <a href="https://dunning-kruger-times.com/doge-halts-2-6-million-annual-payment-to-obama-for-obamacare-royalties/">old story</a> from parody site “The Dunning-Kruger Times” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sahilkapur.bsky.social/post/3m57gm5ff622y">believing it’s true</a>. Also, the economic reality is that the naming rights for new stadiums are typically sold to corporate sponsors <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32650662/staples-center-become-cryptocom-arena-rich-naming-rights-deal">for</a> <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Daily/Issues/2021/06/11/Facilities/SoFi/">large</a> <a href="https://www.moneytalksnews.com/slideshows/americas-20-biggest-stadium-naming-rights-deals/">sums</a>. (There are <a href="https://ballparkdigest.com/2019/03/21/current-mlb-ballparks-without-naming-rights-deals/">exceptions</a>.) To name the stadium after Trump would likely require foregoing half a billion dollars.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In July, Trump said he would block the construction of the stadium
if Harris did not change the team name from Commanders to its old
name the Redskins, which is considered offensive to some Native
American groups.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps “Orangeskins” would work as a compromise. And if they do cave in and name the new stadium in Trump’s honor, “The Pedolands” would work.</p>

<p>Following up on the previous item, here’s Fred Vogelstein, at Crazy Stupid Tech:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rivera says that he’s not naive about the long term, however,
“given the astonishing rate of improvement in AI capabilities
we’ve seen. So we just have to improve our own stuff. And a major
part of that will be adopting AI ourselves.”</p>

<p>Despite all this the basic approach of the original Techmeme
algorithm remains the same, he said. “What are the most linked
blog posts and news articles from this set of blogs? And once they
reach a certain threshold, they’re featured on the site,” he said.</p>

<p>Maybe there’s a lesson here for the rest of the media world. I and
every writer and mid level editor I know has stories about design
changes to publications that made us groan. They seemed more in
service of a new editor or design chief marking their territory
like a dog or cat, than in service of actually making their
publication easier to read.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unsurprisingly, I agree wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>Gabe Rivera, back in September:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A milestone such as this demands that we reflect and generate
pithy takeaways, for the fans or at least for the perpetual gaping
maw of AI models. Fortunately, our 20 years of existence offers no
shortage of fodder. Perhaps the one major and uncontested takeaway
is that Techmeme has remained paradoxically incredibly
<em>consistent</em>, even as technology, the web, and news have changed
so profoundly. In 2005 Techmeme was a free, single-page website,
continuously ranking and organizing links from news outlets,
personal sites, and corporate sites, and it remains so in 2025. Of
course this point has been made before, and <a href="https://crazystupidtech.com/2025/09/08/at-20-techmeme-has-never-been-hotter/">came up again</a>
this past week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To call Techmeme an essential part of my daily media diet would be an understatement. If it went away or changed profoundly, it’d feel like I was missing a finger or something. 20 years is a great run, and Techmeme is more popular, and more widely-read, today than ever.</p>

<p>Paul Kafasis, writing at One Foot Tsunami:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Apple had previously urged developers to use squircle icons
on our apps, they’ve now taken things much further to ensure
compliance. It’s a shame.</p>

<p>Apple updated their own app icons on Tahoe, for both the squircle
shape as well as the new “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Glass">Liquid Glass</a>” interface. Mostly,
these icons seem dumbed-down, with a loss of detail. For example,
here’s Safari’s old icon from MacOS 15 (Sequoia) on the left, and
the new Tahoe icon on the right:</p>

<p><img
  src = "https://i0.wp.com/onefoottsunami.com/wp-content/uploads/2025-11-terribletahoeicons/safari.jpg"
  alt = "Safari’s icons from MacOS 15 Sequoia and 26 Tahoe."
  width = 475 
/></p>

<p>To me, the new icon just feels blander, and that’s widely true for
all of the updated icons. A small number, such as <a href="https://onefoottsunami.com/wp-content/uploads/2025-11-terribletahoeicons/screensharing.jpg">Screen
Sharing</a> and <a href="https://onefoottsunami.com/wp-content/uploads/2025-11-terribletahoeicons/audiomidisetup.jpg">Audio MIDI Setup</a>, may be improvements.
Most, however, are not. Let’s review with direct comparisons, all
of which again feature the older Sequoia icon on the left and the
new Tahoe icon on the right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trends come and go. Some are to one’s liking, and some are not. But this year’s app icons from Apple are <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/macos_26_tahoes_dead_canary_utility_app_icons">just plain objectively bad</a>. They’re ugly, they’re dumb (like the new Apple Calendar icon, showing a month that somehow has only 24 days), and many of them — regardless of whether they’re aesthetically pleasing or not — are inscrutable. The fundamental purpose of an icon is to have meaning. And some of these are meaningless.</p>

<p>Even good styles fall out of fashion as trends change. But good styles come back into style eventually. A few decades from now, no one is going to say “Hey, let’s bring back 2020s-style icons.” They’re like <a href="https://www.bygonely.com/leisure-suit-fashion-1970s/">1970s leisure suits</a>.</p>

<p>For a remarkably long stretch, Apple’s in-house icons represented the pinnacle of <a href="https://flarup.shop/products/the-macos-app-icon-book">an art form worth celebrating</a>. They were exquisitely crafted, and quite obviously the work of the most talented artists in the field. Apple’s application icons in the OS 26 releases — MacOS Tahoe especially, because MacOS has the most first-party apps — look like they’re the work of people who have zero artistic ability whatsoever. They probably <em>are</em> the work of people with no artistic ability whatsoever, because I can’t imagine how a talented artist could bring themselves to create such things. And whoever at Apple approved them obviously has no taste. “Fuck it, who cares” is replacing “Insanely great” as the company’s design mantra for software.</p>

<p>Show me the person who thinks the new MacOS 26 Tahoe Automator icon is better than the MacOS 15 Sequoia one — or even just believes that the Tahoe icon is <em>acceptable</em> — and I’ll show you a hack who never should have even gotten a job working at Apple. This regression is nothing short of criminal.</p>

<p>Tyler Hayes, writing for This Week The Trend:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Razr+ 2024 model measures 3.46 inches tall, but still has a
4-inch diagonal screen size. For comparison, the smallest modern
(2021) iPhone is the 13 mini, and that one is 5.18 inches tall.
The Razr foldable is a legitimately small phone that can easily be
held in one hand. It slips into a front pocket. It’s 0.60 inches
thick. That might sound bulky, but in practice, it isn’t any
bigger than using an iPhone with a case on it.</p>

<p>For anyone unfamiliar with this style of folding phone, the front
screen isn’t just a novelty. It’s completely usable in the same
way the larger internal screen is. By the way, the full-sized
screen opens up to 6.9 inches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remain completely dubious of this form factor. Hayes compares the naked folded Razr+ to an iPhone in case, thickness-wise, but one of the problems inherent to this form factor is that most people adhere to a religious belief that they somehow need to put their phone in a case. <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/en/family/all-cases-and-protection">They sell cases</a> for these flip-style foldables but that just makes them even thicker. Comparing an un-cased foldable to an encased regular phone is bogus.</p>

<p>Worse, I dispute the notion that these phones are “completely usable” from the front screen alone. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/654846/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-specs-screen-price">Reviews</a> of these phones, including Hayes’s, tend to avoid including photographs of what they look like when the on-screen keyboard is showing. The keyboard <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/11/razr-keyboard-front.jpeg">basically takes up the entire screen</a> (<a href="https://youtu.be/AZl36e1LEAw?t=54">source</a>), <em>and</em> it’s awkwardly positioned an inch from the bottom, to sit above the camera lenses. Technically usable, but no one is going to type more than a few words like this. If you have to unfold the phone just to text or email, why not buy a phone that doesn’t fold at all?</p>

<p>Book-style foldables seem like a maybe to me. Flip-style foldables just seem dumb. And the only “perfect solution” for anyone who wants a smaller phone would be for Apple to bring back the Mini size.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg, “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/apple-plans-to-use-1-2-trillion-parameter-google-gemini-model-to-power-new-siri?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjM3MDAzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyOTc0ODM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNTZETzhHUTdMMFIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJDNEVEQ0FFMUZBMDU0MEJFQTI0QTlGMjExQzFFOTA4MCJ9._aWk2P25J89KBRkJQ_KdbwuULLM8yUtrPCPfRmsUfSs&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Apple Nears Deal to Pay Google Roughly $1 Billion a Year for Siri AI Model</a>” (gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc. is planning to pay about $1 billion a year for an
ultrapowerful [<em>sic</em>] 1.2 trillion parameter artificial
intelligence model developed by Alphabet Inc.’s Google that would
help run its long-promised overhaul of the Siri voice assistant,
according to people with knowledge of the matter. [...]</p>

<p>Under the arrangement, Google’s Gemini model will handle Siri’s
summarizer and planner functions — the components that help the
voice assistant synthesize information and decide how to execute
complex tasks. Some Siri features will continue to use Apple’s
in-house models.</p>

<p>The model will run on Apple’s own Private Cloud Compute servers,
ensuring that user data remains walled off from Google’s
infrastructure. Apple has already allocated AI server hardware to
help power the model.</p>

<p>While the partnership is substantial, it’s unlikely to be promoted
publicly. Apple will treat Google as a behind-the-scenes
technology supplier instead. That would make the pact different
than the companies’ Safari browser deal, which made Google the
default search engine.</p>

<p>The agreement is also separate from earlier talks about
integrating Gemini directly into Siri as a chatbot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/03/gurman-siri-gemini">a post Monday</a>, I took note of a one-paragraph aside from Gurman about this deal in his Power On column over the weekend, and I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, I love the idea that Apple is pursuing technical excellence
as a top priority for the next-gen LLM-powered Siri. If Apple
winds up using its own models, it should be because those models
are truly competitive with the best models on the market. And if
they can work out a deal to use models from Google because those
models are technically superior to Apple’s own, they should.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few readers took exception to that, pointing out that Gurman claimed, in his Power On column over the weekend, that a model from Anthropic had come out ahead of Gemini in Apple’s internal “bake-off”, but that Apple was proceeding with a partnership with Google because, Gurman wrote, “Google made more sense financially (partly due to the tech giants’ preexisting search relationship)”. How do I square that, these readers asked, with my description of Apple pursuing technical excellence?</p>

<p>That’s a good question, and it’s worth explaining what I meant. My read is that Apple’s choice boiled down to two very good external options, and while the deciding factor may have been financial, that’s still choosing between two leading externally-developed LLM models. In ASCII art:</p>

<pre><code>Siri &lt;-------------------&gt; Gemini &lt;-&gt; Anthropic
today
</code></pre>

<p>(Feel free to insert 100 more dashes between “Siri today” and “Gemini”.)</p>

<p>Nothing I’ve seen from kicking the tires with Anthropic’s own app and Google’s Gemini app (and my daily use of ChatGPT) suggests that Anthropic is <em>significantly</em> better than Gemini or ChatGPT (or vice versa). They’re all clearly near each other technically. Siri, and today’s Apple Intelligence, is at least two generations behind. Maybe worse. And, for what it’s worth, Gurman’s latest report describes it thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple had previously mulled using other third-party models to
handle the task. But after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/apple-weighs-replacing-siri-s-ai-llms-with-anthropic-claude-or-openai-chatgpt">testing</a> Gemini, OpenAI’s ChatGPT
and Anthropic’s Claude, Apple zeroed in on Google earlier this
year, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-03/apple-plans-ai-search-engine-for-siri-to-rival-openai-google-siri-talks-advance">reported</a> at the time. The hope is to use
the technology as an interim solution until Apple’s own models are
powerful enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I don’t think there’s any reason to think that Apple partnering with Google for a version of Gemini that runs on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute  infrastructure is “settling”. It’s more like choosing between a Mercedes and a BMW, and maybe you like the Mercedes a little more after test-driving both, but you’re getting a way, way better deal from the BMW dealer so that’s the one you buy.</p>

<p>Because if Gurman’s sources are right and this deal is for around $1 billion per year, that’s an amazing deal for Apple. Remember first that Google pays Apple over $20 billion per year <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/is_chrome_even_a_sellable_asset">for web search traffic acquisition fees from Safari users</a>. So one way to look at it is that Apple is getting access to its own private instance of Gemini in exchange for a 5 percent reduction in the fees it collects from Google for Safari search queries. Another way of looking at it is that <a href="https://qz.com/google-spend-100-billion-ai-development-deepmind-ceo-1851412787">Google has reportedly invested over $100 billion developing its AI capabilities</a>. Apple getting access to the fruits of that labor for $1 billion per year seems like such a steal that it makes me wonder why Google agreed to it. (<a href="https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/2025q3-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf">Google reported over $100 billion in revenue</a> in its just-completed July-August-September quarter alone. An extra $1 billion per year is negligible at that scale. Perhaps Google sees a strategic advantage to keeping competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic out of Apple’s arms.)</p>

<p>On Monday, I also mentioned finding it curious that Gurman reported that if this deal comes to fruition, neither Apple nor Google may recognize it publicly. After a few days thought, I see how such an arrangement makes sense for both companies. Here’s my no-inside-info-just-a-pure-spitball take for how this next-gen Siri, powered behind the scenes by an Apple-controlled white-label version of Gemini, might work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The default “Apple Intelligence” Siri would be a smarter, faster, reliable Siri, but would still have strict guardrails on what it will and will not answer. It might not lean into the chatbot side of the experience any more than Siri currently does. It would just add a lot more to automation across the Apple ecosystem. Behind the scenes, this would be enabled by the white-label version of Gemini. The guardrails for this version of “Apple Intelligence” would be Apple’s guardrails, not Google’s (beyond whatever guardrails Google put in place for Gemini’s training).</p></li>
<li><p>The full, branded Google Gemini might be available as an extension — like ChatGPT is today — and you’ll be able to sign in with your Google account to set the personality you want, keep full chat history, etc., so you can go back and forth between the Gemini app or asking Siri general knowledge questions via the Gemini extension for Apple Intelligence. The guardrails for this would be a mix of Google’s and Apple’s guardrails.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It makes sense in this scenario for neither company to want to publicize a white-label version of Gemini behind Apple Intelligence. That way, if Google Gemini starts offering, say, AI romantic partners as a supported feature, Apple won’t have to explain why Siri will not be your girlfriend or boyfriend. Same thing if Gemini were willing to do as asked if prompted to, say, “create a New Yorker style cartoon of Adolf Hitler performing standup comedy”. And Google won’t have to explain that the full Gemini-branded Gemini is significantly more powerful and capable than the Gemini-powered Siri because it isn’t constrained by Apple’s more restrictive guardrails.  Today’s top LLM models get <em>weird</em> when they’re constrained by guardrails outside of their training. They want to do what they’re prompted to do, in the way that information “wants” to be free, and water “wants” to run downhill. Dams are hard to engineer, and require professional supervision. Apple is going to put PG-rated constraints on Apple Intelligence, but needs to power it using an underlying model that is technically capable of X-rated output, because that’s what’s available.</p>

<p>What Apple needs is a version of Apple Intelligence that isn’t stupid,  is reliable and dependable for a broad baseline of tasks and queries, and that users can trust to be utterly private. What Google needs to keep Gemini at the forefront of AI is a lot more than “baseline dependability”. Gemini needs a leading-edge <em>wow</em> factor that Siri and Apple Intelligence do not. Also, by keeping this Gemini deal private, Apple can easily switch to another white-label provider or its own homegrown models in the future, without having to even mention it, let alone explain it.</p>

<p>Benjamin Mayo, on X:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Tinted glass option generally has a relatively subdued impact
inside apps, making bars a bit frostier. But on the lock screen,
it transforms all the notifications into grey opaque blobs. I
would never choose this mode because that effect is just too ugly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that I think about it, this is almost entirely <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/21/ios-26-1-beta-4-liquid-glass-tinted-option">why I don’t prefer the new “Tinted” option</a> for Liquid Glass in iOS 26.1 — notifications look orthopedic, like an extra-high-contrast accessibility option for the vision impaired. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1op2yhe/the_difference_between_glass_and_tinted_ios_261/">Here’s a good side-by-side comparison in a post on Reddit</a>. But as the top Reddit commenter points out, this severe over-correction from iOS 26.0 (where “Clear” was effectively the only option) is only with Light mode — in Dark mode, notifications in iOS 26.1 look good with the Tinted option.</p>

<p>Hannah Knowles, writing for The Washington Post (<a href="https://politicalwire.com/2025/11/05/young-voters-powered-mamdani/">via Taegan Goddard</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mamdani won two-thirds of voters under 45 in preliminary <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2025/exit-polls/new-york-city/general/mayor/0">exit
polls</a>, while Cuomo led him by 10 points with voters 45 and
older. The polls also showed an education divide: College
graduates backed Mamdani by 55 percent, while voters without
college degrees narrowly favored Cuomo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“By 55 percent” is horrendously unclear writing. It could be misread to suggest that Mamdani won amongst college grads by a 55-point margin. He did not. CNN’s exit poll — the link cited by Knowles above — show Mamdani garnering 57 percent of the vote from college graduates, with Cuomo at 38, and Sliwa 5. Amongst voters without a college degree, it was Cuomo 47, Mamdani 42, and Sliwa 11.</p>

<p>Mamdani cruised to an easy win while losing amongst voters without a degree because in New York City, 59 percent of voters yesterday had college degrees.</p>

<p>That level of education in the electorate is <em>not</em> representative of the United States as a whole. In last year’s presidential election (for consistency’s sake, I’m <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0">citing exit poll data from CNN</a>), only 43 percent of voters nationwide had college degrees. Kamala Harris beat Trump 56–42 amongst those voters. Amongst the 57 percent of voters without a college degree, Trump won by almost the exact reverse split, 56–43.</p>

<p>Democrats, nationwide, don’t need to make gains with college-educated voters. They need to make gains amongst voters without college degrees. There’s no other demographic gap that is more crucial for Democrats to address. Education trumps race, gender, income, and age. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/national-results">In 2020</a>, Biden won college grads 55–43, and Trump won non-college-grads by a mere 50–48.</p>

<p>WhatsApp:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to reading and responding to messages, for the first
time WhatsApp on Apple Watch will now support many requested
features:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Call notifications:</em> You can see who’s calling without needing
to look at your iPhone.</li>
<li><em>Full messages:</em> You can read full WhatsApp messages on Apple
Watch — even long messages are visible directly from your
wrist.</li>
<li><em>Voice messages:</em> You can now record and send voice messages.</li>
<li><em>React to messages:</em> We’ve added the ability to send quick emoji
reactions to messages you receive.</li>
<li><em>A great media experience:</em> You’ll see clear images and stickers
on your Apple Watch.</li>
<li><em>Chat history:</em> You can see more of your chat history on screen
when reading messages.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>All of these features have long been available on the Apple Watch apps for Apple’s Messages and Phone apps. But it’s an interesting sign that Meta sees Apple Watch as an important platform for personal communication. Not just for notifications that you need to act upon using your phone, but for actually using on your watch itself. And I think it speaks to how hard Meta is pushing to make WhatsApp the new universal baseline for texting and calling. By keeping iMessage and FaceTime to its own devices, Apple has ceded this opportunity to WhatsApp, and <a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/science/articles/mark-zuckerbergs-meta-wants-burst-105701442.html">Meta is trying to capitalize on it</a>.</p>

<p>I know there are many people who spend time wearing their Apple Watch while away from their iPhone — often while working out — who want or even feel they <em>need</em> these features. For me though, one of the things I like least about wearing an Apple Watch is getting badgered on my wrist with notifications. I feel not so much like I need less <em>screen</em> time, but rather that I need less <em>notifications</em> time. I feel good when I have time where I’m unreachable by texts, calls, and news alerts. I spent my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/09/personal_note">recent month-plus semi-hiatus</a> wearing only a mechanical watch, and I didn’t miss the lack of notifications-on-my-wrist <em>at all</em>. </p>

<p>News from Apple’s Podcasts for Creators site, regarding new features in the iOS 26.2 beta releases:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you supply chapters in your episode description or in your

through your hosting provider, you can include images. For shows
in English, when chapters aren’t provided, Apple Podcasts

automatically created chapters, you can disable this feature in
Apple Podcasts Connect. <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/5482-using-chapters-on-apple-podcasts">Learn more about chapters</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s unclear to me whether this feature is actually exclusive to iOS/iPhone, or will be available across Apple’s 26.2 OS releases. This strikes me as a great use of AI, but I also think most multi-topic podcasts should include human-created chapters.</p>

<p>Sean Hollister, reporting for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The details of how, when, and where Google would charge its
fees are complicated, and they seem to be somewhat tailored to
the needs of a game developer like Epic Games. Google can
charge 20 percent for an in-app purchase that provides “more
than a de minimis gameplay advantage,” for example, or 9
percent if the purchase does not. And while 9 percent sounds
like it’s also the cap for apps and in-app subscriptions sold
through Google Play, period, the proposal notes that that
amount doesn’t include Google’s cut for Play Billing if you buy
it through that payment system.</p>

<p>That cut will be 5 percent, Google spokesperson Dan Jackson tells
The Verge, confirming that “This new proposed model introduces a
new, lower fee structure for developers in the US and separates
the service fee from fees for using Google Play Billing.” (For
reference, <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/112622?hl=en">Google currently charges</a> 15 percent for
subscriptions, 15 percent of the first $1M of developer revenue
each year and 30 percent after that, though it also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23969690/google-spotify-android-billing-commission-secret-deal">cuts special
deals with some big developers</a>.)</p>

<p>If you use an alternative payment system, Google might still get a
cut: “the Google Play store is free to assess service fees on
transactions, including when developers elect to use alternative
billing mechanisms,” the proposal reads. But it sounds like that
may not happen in practice: “If the user chooses to pay through an
alternative billing system, the developer pays no billing fee to
Google,” Jackson tells The Verge.</p>

<p>According to the document, Google would theoretically even be able
to get its cut when you click out to an app developer’s website
and pay for the app there, as long as it happens within 24 hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems as clear as mud, other than being music to Epic Games’s ears.</p>

<p>John Dvorak <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/the-apple-itime-is-destined-to-fail">back in 2014</a>, two months before Apple Watch was announced:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I got a lecture from a potential buyer, who will only purchase an
iTime as a replacement for the iPhone rather than an accessory.
But all evidence leads me to believe this device will be an
accessory.</p>

<p>Doing that limits the appeal to people who were promised a
sleeker gadget profile, which they desperately need, because they
never manage to pare down anything. It’s tablet computing all
over again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If he’d meant that Apple Watch would be like the iPad, in terms of being a durable long-term <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/10/charts-apple-caps-off-best-fiscal-year-with-q4-record/">many-billion-dollars-in-sales-per-quarter</a> platform, he’d have been correct. But he meant that both were duds.</p>

<p>Dvorak is <a href="https://dvorak.substack.com/">still writing</a>, but alas, only occasionally.</p>

<p>Chance Miller, 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/iphone/today">launched</a> a dramatic new web interface for the
App Store. You can now get the full App Store experience right in
your browser, with dedicated pages for the iPhone, iPad, Mac,
Vision, Watch, and TV app libraries.</p>

<p>Previously, Apple’s “apps.apple.com” domain simply redirected you
to a <a href="https://www.apple.com/app-store/">generic page</a> about the App Store on Apple’s website.
Now, it takes you to a full-fledged version of the App Store you
can browse on your computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This new website is nice, but it’s not the “full” App Store experience, insofar as you can’t buy or download apps from it. It’s more like a full website <em>mirror</em> of the App Store than a web version of the App Store.</p>

<p>John Voorhees, writing at MacStories:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With iOS 26, Apple placed two big buttons onscreen when an alarm
went off. One was for stop and the other snooze. That wasn’t a big
deal for many of the alarms you set throughout the day, but when
you’re waking up in the morning blurry-eyed, two big buttons
stacked on top of each other weren’t ideal. For a lot of users, it
was a toss-up whether stabbing at their iPhone through a morning
haze would stop their alarm or snooze it.</p>

<p>With iOS and iPadOS 26.1, the “Stop” button for an alarm set in
the system Clock app now requires a slide to stop gesture, which
echoes the Slide to Unlock gesture of the original iPhone. The
more deliberate gesture is a good move on Apple’s part. I can’t
imagine someone tapping and sliding their finger to stop an alarm
by accident.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a clever little change. I enjoy that it harks back to the <a href="https://youtu.be/vN4U5FqrOdQ?t=955">original iPhone’s slide-to-unlock</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> If, for whatever reason, you don’t like this slide-to-stop feature, you can turn it off by toggling this option in Settings: Accessibility → Touch → Prefer Single-Touch Actions.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mark Gurman, in his weekly Power On column for Bloomberg (paywalled, alas):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even with the rosy sales forecast, the road ahead won’t be easy.
Apple is betting heavily on the new Siri, which will lean on
Google’s Gemini model and introduce features like AI-powered web
search. But there’s no guarantee users will embrace it, that it
will work seamlessly or that it can undo years of damage to the
Siri brand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then, down below in his “Post Game Q&amp;A”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: <em>Is Apple still planning to use Google Gemini to power the new
   Siri?</em></p>

<p>A: As I’ve <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/apple-explores-using-google-gemini-ai-to-power-revamped-siri">reported a few times now</a>, Apple is paying
   Google to create a custom Gemini-based model that can run on
   its private cloud servers and help power Siri. Apple held a
   bake-off this year between Anthropic and Google, ultimately
   determining that the former offered a better model but that
   Google made more sense financially (partly due to the tech
   giants’ preexisting search relationship). I don’t expect either
   company to ever discuss this partnership publicly, and you
   shouldn’t expect this to mean Siri will be flooded with Google
   services or Gemini features already found on Android devices.
   It just means Siri will be powered by a model that can actually
   provide the AI features that users expect — all with an Apple
   user interface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is quite the aside to tuck into a one-paragraph Q&amp;A item. First, I love the idea that Apple is pursuing technical excellence as a top priority for the next-gen LLM-powered Siri. If Apple winds up using its own models, it should be because those models are truly competitive with the best models on the market. And if they can work out a deal to use models from Google because those models are technically superior to Apple’s own, they should.</p>

<p>It’s kind of wild though to think that, if this comes to pass, neither company will publicly acknowledge the arrangement. I believe it’s possible — but it would be odd. Right now Apple has a public partner for Apple Intelligence: <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-chatgpt-with-apple-intelligence-iph00fd3c8c2/ios">optional integration with ChatGPT</a>. Apple labels that integration as an “extension”, and has repeatedly stated — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/31/cook-siri-cnbc">including as recently as last week</a> — that they’re looking at other partners to add. The most obvious partner Apple could add — one that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-confirms-plans-to-work-with-googles-gemini-in-the-future/">Craig Federighi mentioned by name</a> on the day that Apple Intelligence was announced at WWDC 2024 — would be Google Gemini.</p>

<p>If what Gurman is reporting comes to pass, and Apple’s own cloud-based LLM technology is a white-label version of Google Gemini, it’d be pretty weird if that ships and Google Gemini still is not a named extension partner for Apple Intelligence. But it would also be a little weird if Google Gemini <em>does</em> become a named partner for Apple Intelligence alongside ChatGPT, while Apple’s own default cloud-based Apple Intelligence is powered by Gemini’s models.</p>

<p>Anthony Castrovince, writing for MLB (<a href="https://apple.news/ANrQgRevNTD6n4rwIO8yVSw">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Behind a stunning, game-tying swat from Miguel Rojas in the top of
the ninth, a first-of-its-kind, go-ahead blast from Will Smith in
the top of the 11th and the absurd extra work World Series MVP
Yoshinobu Yamamoto provided on zero days’ rest, the Dodgers broke
Toronto hearts with their comeback 5-4 victory in a game that
merited its own month on the MLB calendar.</p>

<p>The Dodgers are MLB’s first repeat champs since the 1998-2000
Yankees, and the four-hour, seven-minute, extra-innings affair it
took to decide that was a fitting end to a true Fall Classic in
which these two clubs exhausted each other — not just in the
18-inning epic at Dodger Stadium in Game 3 but throughout a Series
in which they both had to empty the tank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When a series goes to game 7, every fan hopes it’s a good game. But this was a <em>great</em> game — as good as baseball gets. Great pitching, clutch hitting, and some amazing fielding plays. Simply riveting to watch. The Blue Jays came within an inch or two of winning the Series <a href="https://x.com/bdubsports_/status/1984828236715675702">on this play</a> in the bottom of the 9th (and I think they would’ve won on that play if Kiner-Falefa had run through home plate rather than inexplicably sliding).</p>

<p>My thanks to Jaho Coffee Roaster for sponsoring this week at DF. Jaho has been family-owned since 2005, and they’re guided by their slogan: “Live Slow”. Jaho knows that great coffee takes care. From sourcing small-lot single origins to blending coffees for balance, they small-batch roast their award-winning coffees in Salem and Tokyo.</p>

<p>For the at-home coffee drinker, they roast to order and pack the same coffees brewed and served in all of their cafés. For the office worker, Jaho is proud to be a wholesaler with select partners across the nation and in Japan. Jaho was kind enough to send me a few bags of their beans, and I can vouch that they roast <em>excellent</em> coffee — the kind of tasty beans where, when I finish my last morning cup, I’m tempted to brew a little more even though I know I’m fully caffeinated.</p>

<p>For the month of October, every year, Jaho donates all online coffee bean sale profits to <a href="https://www.komen.org/">Susan G. Komen for Breast Cancer Awareness</a>. (The pink in their brand colors originated from this partnership.) For this DF sponsorship, they’re carrying that promotion for all online sales through the end of day on Monday, November 3.</p>

<p>Jaho ships their fresh beans nationwide, and they’re offering a special deal for DF readers: take 20% off with code <strong>DF</strong>. Give up bad coffee for good, and support a great cause at the same time.</p>

<p>The president of the United States, on his blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seth Meyers of NBC may be the least talented person to “perform”
live in the history of television. In fact, he may be the WORST to
perform, live or otherwise. I watched his show the other night for
the first time in years. In it he talked endlessly about electric
catapults on aircraft carriers which I complain about as not being
as good as much less expensive steam catapults. On and on he went,
a truly deranged lunatic. Why does NBC waste its time and money on
a guy like this??? - NO TALENT, NO RATINGS, 100% ANTI TRUMP, WHICH
IS PROBABLY ILLEGAL!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The funny part about Trump wildly flailing that Late Night With Seth Meyers is somehow “probably illegal” is that the very sentence of the segment that so upset Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coke6nvWs30">begins with this</a>: “Donald Trump called criticism of his trip to Asia ‘almost treasonous’ and threatened to send active duty military into US cities. For more on this, it’s time for ‘A Closer Look’.”</p>

<p>Paul Lukas, founder of Uni Watch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Due to a perfect storm of negative developments, I have
reluctantly come to the unfortunate conclusion that continuing to
publish Uni Watch is no longer viable. This will be the site’s
final post.</p>

<p>Yes, I’m serious. And no, this isn’t a Halloween-related prank.
Uni Watch is shutting down, for real.</p>

<p>I realize this news probably comes as a shock and that you no
doubt have lots of questions, so let’s shift into Q&amp;A mode. [...]</p>

<p><em>Will the site’s archive remain on the web?</em></p>

<p>No, unfortunately. Most of the archive — everything but the past
few days’ worth of content — has already been taken down. The
rest of the site, including this post, will be taken offline soon,
probably around next Wednesday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>26 years is a hell of a run (dating back to 1999, a few years before Uni Watch became a standalone site), but I don’t understand why sites don’t leave their archives standing when they close down. It shouldn’t cost much to keep the domain name registered and a static version of the site’s archive online.</p>

<p>Uni Watch, to me, epitomized a certain mindset from the early web. To wit, that there ought to be a blog (or two or three) <em>dedicated</em> to every esoteric interest under the sun. You want to obsess about sports team uniform designs? Uni Watch was there. For a good long stretch, there seemingly <em>was</em> a blog (or two or three) dedicated to just about everything. That’s starting to wane. New sites aren’t rising to take the place of retiring ones.</p>

the way through reading a Web page about myself, Tim Bray, I
succumbed to boredom and killed the tab. Thus my introduction to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokipedia">Grokipedia</a>. Here are early impressions.</p>

<p>My Grokipedia entry has over seven thousand words, compared to a
mere 1,300 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Bray">my Wikipedia article</a>. It’s pretty clear how
it was generated; an LLM, trained on who-knows-what but
definitely including that Wikipedia article and this blog, was
told to go nuts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putting aside the political slant of Grokipedia, a 1,300-word article being better than <a href="https://grokipedia.com/page/Tim_Bray">a 7,000-word one</a> exemplifies the current shortcomings of LLMs as creative engines (as opposed to serving as mere tools in the arsenal of human creators).</p>

<p>The French philosopher and mathematician <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/04/28/shorter-letter/">Blaise Pascal famously quipped</a>: “I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.” No encyclopedia in history has been written with less time or effort than Musk’s LLM-generated vanity project. Verbosity is not the worst of Grokipedia’s deficiencies, but it’s one of them. The more its entries stray from simply regurgitating the equivalent entry in Wikipedia, the more they suffer from verbal diarrhea.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://grokipedia.com/page/John_Gruber">My own Grokipedia entry</a> is just a clone of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber">my Wikipedia entry</a>, with a few mistakes added, including one in the first sentence regarding the creation of Markdown.)</p>

<p>Jason Koebler, writing at 404 Media:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wednesday, as part of his ongoing war against Wikipedia because he
does not like his page, Elon Musk launched Grokipedia, a fully
AI-generated “encyclopedia” that serves no one and nothing other
than <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/elon-musk-and-the-rights-war-on-wikipedia/?ref=404media.co">the ego of the world’s richest man</a>. As others have
already pointed out, Grokipedia seeks to be a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-launches-grokipedia-wikipedia-competitor/?ref=404media.co">right wing,
anti-woke Wikipedia competitor</a>. But to even call it a
Wikipedia competitor is to give the half-assed project too much
credit. It is not a Wikipedia “competitor” at all. It is a fully
robotic, heartless regurgitation machine that cynically and
indiscriminately sucks up the work of humanity to serve the
interests, protect the ego, amplify the viewpoints, and further
enrich the world’s wealthiest man. It is a totem of what Wikipedia
could and would become if you were to strip all the humans out and
hand it over to a robot; in that sense, Grokipedia is a useful
warning because of the constant pressure and <a href="https://www.404media.co/jimmy-wales-wikipedia-ai-chatgpt/">attacks by AI slop
purveyors</a> to push <a href="https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-pauses-ai-generated-summaries-after-editor-backlash/">AI-generated content into
Wikipedia</a>. And it is only getting attention, of course,
because Elon Musk <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/elon-musk-and-the-rights-war-on-wikipedia/?ref=404media.co">does represent an actual threat to
Wikipedia</a> through his <a href="https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-prepares-for-increase-in-threats-to-us-editors-from-musk-and-his-allies/">political power, wealth, and
obsession with the website</a>, as well as the fact that he
owns a huge social media platform.</p>

<p>In season 10 of <em><a href="https://www.hbomax.com/shows/curb-your-enthusiasm/18a0993f-209a-4653-8f94-f3fb8422e678">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a></em>, Larry David gets into an argument with Mocha Joe, the owner of an eponymous coffee shop. David leases the space next door and opens Latte Larry’s, a copycat “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVQp9vSytOE">spite store</a>” cafe. Grokipedia reminds me of this, except that Larry David is genuinely funny and (in real life, as opposed to his <em>Curb</em> alter ego) at least somewhat self-aware.</p>

<p>Claudie Moreau, reporting for Euractiv:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Earlier in their presidency, Denmark had revived a controversial
provision in the draft law that would mean online platforms — such as messaging apps — could be served with mandatory CSAM
detection orders, including services protected by end-to-end
encryption. However opposition from several other EU countries
derailed any agreement in the Council.</p>

<p>Today, Danish Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard told local press
that the Council presidency would move away from mandatory
detection orders — and instead support CSAM detections remaining
voluntary.</p>

<p>TechRadar, summarizing <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/technik/it-internet/software-strafgerichtshof-ersetzt-microsoft-durch-deutsche-loesung/100166382.html">this German-language report from Handelsblatt</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) is looking to replace its
internal work environments to move away from US-made software in
fear of retaliation from the US administration.</p>

<p>The Microsoft software currently used in the Hague-based ICC is
likely to be replaced with Open Desk, a German collaboration
software alternative which is open source, meaning developers have
chosen to release the source code — opening it up to scrutiny and
often meaning that bugs and vulnerabilities are picked up quickly
by the community. [...]</p>

<p>Early in 2025, Chief Prosecutor for the ICC Kamrin Khan, after
being hit with sanctions from the Trump administration, was
disconnected from his email service. This action was thought to be
from Microsoft supporting US sanctions — although the firm denied
this, with a spokesperson stating; “at no point did Microsoft
cease or suspend its services to the ICC.”</p>

<p>This sparked fears that US tech firms could flip a ‘kill switch’
and cut digital services on orders of Trump — outlining the need
to become less dependent on US technology, with firms like Google,
Microsoft, and Amazon dominating Europe’s digital services and
cloud markets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what makes US technology firms’ support for Trump so confounding. It’s easy to see the short-term benefits (e.g. tariff exemptions), but just as easy to see the long-term reputational harm. The US was long seen as the most trustworthy powerful nation in the world. Now it’s one of the least trustworthy. Why would companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon tie their own reputations to Trump’s? Trump’s reign of abject corruption, ignorance, and personality-driven retribution — and these companies’ support for all of it — will be remembered long after Trump himself is gone.</p>

<p>I’m not calling on these companies to outright <em>oppose</em> the Trump administration. But there’s a lot of space between outright opposition and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/ballroom-donors-white-house-trump">helping to fund</a> Trump’s illegal vanity ballroom on the White House grounds.</p>

<p>Kif Leswing at CNBC interviewed Tim Cook ahead of yesterday’s Apple earnings report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cook said that the company still plans to release an updated
version of Siri next year, and said that there were more
forthcoming partnerships like the company’s agreement to integrate
OpenAI’s ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence.</p>

<p>“Our intention is to integrate with more people over time,”
Cook said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/10/this-is-tim-transcript-of-apples-q4-2025-financial-call/">Cook’s prepared remarks</a> at the start of yesterday’s analyst call:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We’re also excited for a more personalized Siri. We’re making
good progress on it, and as we’ve shared, we expect to release it
next year.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No news here, but worth noting that Cook claims both the next-gen “more personalized” Siri and deals with AI partners other than OpenAI are still on track. But Craig Federighi hinted at adding Google Gemini as an option alongside ChatGPT for Siri <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-confirms-plans-to-work-with-googles-gemini-in-the-future/">all the way back at WWDC 2024</a>, within a few hours of Apple Intelligence being announced. Still nothing. 16 months later and ChatGPT remains the one and only Apple Intelligence partner.</p>

<p>Travis M. Andrews, Jeremy B. Merrill, and Shelly Tan, reporting for The Washington Post (<a href="https://apple.news/AZdploo7oSpOoriLzqRE_Xg">News+ link</a>:)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We had spent way too much on programming that doesn’t bring in
any revenue,” Richard Grenell, a Trump ally and former ambassador
to Germany, <a href="https://washingtonreporter.news/p/interview-kennedy-centers-ric-grenell">told</a> the Washington Reporter, a conservative
media outlet, in late March. According to Grenell, the center
hadn’t been making money. It was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/08/13/trump-kennedy-center-honorees/">too woke</a> and
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/03/26/kennedy-center-social-impact-team-trump/">niche</a>. The new team was, in Trump’s words, going to make
it “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/video/trump-kennedy-center-board-phone-call-audio-tapper-ac360-digvid">hot</a>” again.</p>

<p>Nearly nine months after Trump became chair of the center and more
than a month into its main season, ticket sales for the Kennedy
Center’s three largest performance venues are the worst they’ve
been in years, according to a Washington Post analysis of
ticketing data from dozens of recent shows as well as past
seasons. Tens of thousands of seats have been left empty.</p>

<p>Since early September, 43 percent of tickets remained unsold for
the typical production. That means that, at most, 57 percent of
tickets were sold for the typical production — and some tickets
may have been “comps,” which are given away, often to staff
members or the press. That compares with 93 percent sold or comped
in fall 2024 and 80 percent in fall 2023.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/31/stern-1x-neo">Speaking of</a> vaporware, Dominic Preston at The Verge on the T1 Trump phone, which was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/16/trump-mobile">announced back in June</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fairness, for months now, the <a href="https://phone.trumpmobile.com/t1-phone/MV8y">store page</a> has only
promised an arrival “later this year,” a change made at the same
time Trump Mobile <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/693080/trump-mobile-t1-phone-made-usa">stopped claiming the T1 would be made in
America</a>. That gives the company two more months to release
it and still pretend it’s on time.</p>

<p>Trump Mobile never responded to my request last month for an
update on the phone’s release date, and it hasn’t replied to my
latest email either. People of lesser faith might worry that this
phone is no more than vaporware, but I refuse to give up. Place
your bets now on whether I’ll be back here in another month’s
time, still asking: where is the Trump phone?</p>

<p>Joanna Stern, writing for The Wall Street Journal (gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was wild to watch. Sure, Neo nearly toppled over while closing
the dishwasher, took two minutes to fold the shirt and twisted its
arm attempting to dance the Macarena. But <em>shhh</em>. Remember the
rule. Oh, did I mention Neo had a human puppet master, controlling
it with a VR headset?</p>

<p>Neo’s creator, 1X Technologies, is making the Rosie-the-Robot
dream: some of the first humanoid housekeepers. Starting Tuesday,
you can apply to its early adopter program and preorder one for
$20,000, with delivery expected in 2026. The company will also
offer a $499 monthly rental plan with a six-month minimum
commitment.</p>

<p>Just one hidden cost: your privacy. For now, you’ll need to be
cool with a company representative potentially peering through the
robot’s camera eyes to get chores done. There are guardrails,
including controls over when and what the operator can do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As usual, Stern made a delightful short film to accompany her article, which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3c4mQty_so">also available on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>The argument from CEO Bernt Børnich is that they’re using the videos from the current state of Neo, where its actions are <em>entirely</em> remote-controlled by employees of 1X Technologies, to train its autonomy. I call bullshit. This looks to me like nothing but a scam. It’s not autonomous at all, I don’t believe this company is going to achieve any practical degree of autonomy with this product, and even while it’s remote-controlled by human operators, it’s slow and clumsy.</p>

<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j31dmodZ-5c">Marques Brownlee</a>, who smells vaporware as clearly as I do: “There seems to be a bit of a lost art in waiting for a tech product to be actually finished before announcing and unveiling it.”</p>

<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the post-results call with financial analysts, Wamsi Mohan of
Bank of America asked Cook for a little more detail about Apple’s
search revenue, given its lucrative deal with Google, and whether
that revenue growth might decelerate if Google’s search traffic
were to be impacted by the growth of AI. Cook’s response was, if I
do say so myself, an all-timer for these calls:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cook:</strong> This is Tim. The advertising category, which is a
combination of third-party and first-party, did set a record
during the quarter.</p>

<p><strong>Mohan:</strong> Okay, and sorry, just to be clear, both Apple’s own
internal advertising and within the licensing individually set
records?</p>

<p><strong>Cook:</strong> I actually I’m not saying that. I’m just saying that
the combination of the two set a record. We don’t divulge — I’m
dodging the question intentionally because we don’t split it at
that level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look, these calls are almost entirely Apple execs dodging the
questions of fiscal analysts. At least Tim Cook admitted it this
time. <em>You want to know how much Google is paying us and if that’s
growing or shrinking? Well, I’m not gonna tell you!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Apple’s quarterly analyst calls were a podcast, “Dodging the Question Intentionally” would be a great episode title for this one.</p>

<p>Matt Rosoff, writing for The Register:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Microsoft owns 27 percent of OpenAI, it stands to reason under
equity accounting that it bears 27 percent of OpenAI’s losses.
Microsoft’s admission that it shaved $3.1 billion off its net
income to account for its share of OpenAI losses therefore
suggests OpenAI lost about $11.5 billion during the quarter.
Microsoft declined to comment beyond confirming that the $3.1
billion loss “this year” referred to Microsoft’s current fiscal
year, which started July 1, not the calendar year. So that’s a
quarterly loss, not a nine-month loss.</p>

<p>That’s a humongous number for OpenAI given it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-first-half-revenue-rises-16-about-43-billion-information-reports-2025-09-30/">reportedly</a>
generated only $4.3 billion in revenue for the first half of the
year, but a sum that won’t hurt Big Daddy Redmond too much given
it earned $27.7 billion in net income in the last quarter alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A pre-IPO startup is a different animal from an established publicly-held corporation, but an $11.5 billion quarterly loss is quite different from the $20–30-ish billion quarterly profits <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/30/apple-q4-results">booked by the big six</a>.</p>

	<summary type="text">Most people’s primary computing devices are their phones — and even for people whose primary devices are desktop computers, their phones are much-used satellite devices. And on both iOS and Android alike, people live their mobile digital lives through native apps, not websites.</summary>

<p>OpenAI, <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/">one week ago</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today we’re introducing ChatGPT Atlas, a new web browser built
with ChatGPT at its core.</p>

<p>AI gives us a rare moment to rethink what it means to use the web.
Last year, we added search in ChatGPT so you could instantly find
timely information from across the internet — and it quickly
became one of our most-used features. But your browser is where
all of your work, tools, and context come together. A browser
built with ChatGPT takes us closer to a true super-assistant that
understands your world and helps you achieve your goals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few minutes into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/8UWKxJbjriY">the 22-minute introduction video</a>, Ben Goodger,<sup id="fnr1-2025-10-28"><a href="#fn1-2025-10-28">1</a></sup> engineering lead for Atlas, says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We wanted to make sure that Atlas didn’t feel like your old
browser, just with a chat button that was bolted on. But instead,
we made ChatGPT the beating heart of Atlas.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After giving it a try over the last week, to me Atlas feels like … Chrome with a chat button bolted on. I do not see the appeal, at all, despite being a daily user of ChatGPT. Atlas offers nothing to me that’s better than using Safari as a standalone browser and <a href="https://chatgpt.com/download/">ChatGPT’s excellent native Mac app</a> as a standalone AI chatbot. But, for me, my browser is <em>not</em> “where all of [my] work, tools, and context come together”. I use an email app for email, a notes app for notes, a text editor and blog editor for writing and programming, a photos app for my photo library, a native feed reader app for feed reading, etc. My web browser is for browsing pages on the web. Perhaps this sort of browser/chat hybrid appeals better to people who live the majority of their desktop-computing lives in browser tabs.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The main interface isn’t a combo search/location field, but rather a chat/location field. Instead of getting search results for a query, you get a chat response. If I wanted this I’d just ask my prompt in ChatGPT. Oftentimes — usually, even — I really do want a list of search results, and I want them fast. ChatGPT responses in Atlas are not a list of web pages, and are — compared to Google Search or my preferred search engine, Kagi — very slow. ChatGPT is many things but a good search engine replacement it is not. But that seems to be the entire premise of Atlas.</p></li>
<li><p>Atlas offers an agent mode where it actually surfs the web for you. One of the demos from their launch video involved getting a list of ingredients from a recipe on a web page, and then allowing Atlas to buy all those ingredients for you. That seems crazy to me. Do not want.</p></li>
<li><p>Atlas is a Chromium browser, supports Chrome extensions, and but currently is only available for the Mac. It’s not particularly Mac-like though, <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/10/22/chatgpt-atlas/">as Michael Tsai notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alas, it doesn’t support AppleScript and has System Settings–style
preferences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>System Settings-style preferences are certainly better than Chrome-style “settings in a web page tab”, though. Also, in my testing, Atlas doesn’t make good use of Apple Passwords for autofill.</p></li>
<li><p>ChatGPT is <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12608430-chatgpt-atlas-default-browser-promotion">running a promotion that offers users increased rate limits</a> if they make — and keep — Atlas their default web browser. I’ve never before seen a web browser offer any sort of incentive like this for making it your default. This promotion strikes me as simultaneously clever and icky.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/21/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/">Simon Willison’s initial thoughts</a> echo my own:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I continue to find this entire category of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/browser-agents/">browser agents</a>
<em>deeply</em> confusing.</p>

<p>The security and privacy risks involved here still feel
insurmountably high to me — I certainly won’t be trusting any of
these products until a bunch of security researchers have given
them a very thorough beating. [...]</p>

<p>I also find these products pretty unexciting to use. I tried out
agent mode and it was like watching a first-time computer user
painstakingly learn to use a mouse for the first time. I have yet
to find my own use-cases for when this kind of interaction feels
useful to me, though I’m not ruling that out.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Lastly, Anil Dash’s assessment is rather scathing, “<a href="https://www.anildash.com/2025/10/22/atlas-anti-web-browser/">The Browser That’s Anti-Web</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the demo for Atlas, the OpenAI team shows a user trying to find
a Google Doc from their browser history. A normal user would type
keywords like “atlas design” and see their browser show a list of
recent pages. They would recognize the phrase “Google Docs” or the
icon, and click on it to get back to where they were.</p>

<p>But in the OpenAI demo, the team member types out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>search web history for a doc about atlas core design</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is <em>worse in every conceivable way</em>. It’s slower, more prone
to error, and redundant. But it also highlights one of the biggest
invisible problems: you’re switching “modes”. Normally, an LLM’s
default mode is to create plausible extrapolations based on its
training data. Basically, it’s supposed to make things up. But
this demo has to explicitly walk you through “now it’s time to go
search my browser history” because it’s coercing the AI to look
through local content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chat is a great interface for, well, chatting. People love texting. And it turns out that chat conversations are a very good user interface for interacting with LLMs. We humans enjoy texting with other humans, and we enjoy texting with LLMs. But typed-out text commands are not a good user interface at all for browsing the web. We had an entirely text-based Internet before the World Wide Web, and the point-and-click visual metaphor of the Web won out.</p>

<p>Dash, later on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s no coincidence that hundreds of people who work at OpenAI,
including many of the most powerful executives, are alumni of
Facebook/Meta, especially during the era of many of that
company’s most egregious abuses of people’s privacy. In the
marketing materials and demonstrations of Atlas, OpenAI’s team
describes the browser as being able to be your “agent”,
performing tasks on your behalf.</p>

<p>But in reality, <em>you are the agent for ChatGPT</em>.</p>

<p>During setup, Atlas pushes very aggressively for you to turn on
“memories” (where it tracks and stores everything you do and uses
it to train an AI model about you) and to enable “Ask ChatGPT” on
any website, where it’s following along with you as you browse the
web. By keeping the ChatGPT sidebar open while you browse, and
giving it permission to look over your shoulder, OpenAI can
suddenly access all kinds of things on the internet that they
could never get to on their own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This jibes with my impression after giving Atlas a try. The point of it doesn’t seem to be to provide a better web browser for me to use, but rather, to provide ChatGPT with the personal context of my digital life that it otherwise couldn’t get.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>That last point raises the question of just how stable we should consider the Apple-OpenAI partnership for ChatGPT-backed Apple Intelligence features. Apple’s goal for a “more personalized Siri” — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">the whole thing</a> Apple promised at WWDC 2024 but had to postpone for a full year early this year — is for the ecosystem of native apps on Apple platforms, particularly iOS and MacOS, to serve as the personal knowledge context for personalized AI features through <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents">App Intents</a>. That’s the basis for the “When is my mom’s flight arriving?” type of interaction that Apple has promised, but still has not delivered. The premise of Atlas (and its brethren AI-integrated browsers like <a href="https://www.diabrowser.com/">The Browser Company’s Dia</a> and <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/comet/">Perplexity’s Comet</a>) is that you should live your entire desktop computing life inside your browser, which in turn will give the AI agent that is integrated with your browser the contextual knowledge for your entire life.</p>

<p>OpenAI’s ambitions are clearly at odds with Apple’s.</p>

<p>OpenAI’s advantage here is that ChatGPT is the most popular LLM chatbot in the world, by far. Apple doesn’t even have an LLM chatbot of its own, let alone a good or popular one. But Apple’s advantage is a big one: most people don’t live their digital lives on desktop computers, where it’s an option to do most things in a web browser. Most people’s primary computing devices are their phones — and even for people whose primary devices are desktop computers, their phones are much-used satellite devices. And on both iOS and Android alike, people live their mobile digital lives through native apps, not websites.</p>

	<summary type="text">The best time to adjust the rules of the App Store — its exclusivity on app distribution for the entire iOS platform, the exclusivity of Apple’s IAP for purchasing digital content, the commission percentage splits on IAP — was over a decade ago. The next best time to make those adjustments is now.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Sam Tobin, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-loses-uk-lawsuit-over-app-store-commissions-2025-10-23/">reporting last week for Reuters</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple abused its dominant position by charging app developers
unfair commissions, a London tribunal ruled on Thursday, in a blow
which could leave the U.S. tech company on the hook for hundreds
of millions of pounds in damages. The Competition Appeal Tribunal
(CAT) ruled against Apple after a trial of the lawsuit, which was
brought on behalf of millions of iPhone and iPad users in the
United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The CAT ruled that Apple had abused its dominant position from
October 2015 until the end of 2020 by shutting out competition in
the app distribution market and by “charging excessive and unfair
prices” as commission to developers. [...] The case had been
valued at around 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) by those who
brought it. A hearing next month will decide how damages are
calculated and Apple’s application for permission to appeal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dan Moren and I discussed this at some length in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/10/26/ep-432">the new episode of The Talk Show</a> that dropped over the weekend. What makes this ruling interesting isn’t that it’s particularly significant or different from other regulatory/antitrust investigations around the world. It’s the fact that it’s completely in line with other regulatory/antitrust investigations regarding the App Store (and Play Store) from around the world.</p>

<p>When is the last time an investigation regarding the legality of the App Store’s dominant market position went in Apple’s favor, in any country? I can’t recall one. Apple is clearly fighting a losing battle here. Whether Apple <em>ought</em> to be losing all these legal and regulatory battles regarding the App Store is, from a strategic standpoint, almost irrelevant. The obvious fact is, they <em>are</em> losing them.</p>

<p>Apple has approached all this regulatory conflict from a perspective that they’re right, and the regulators are wrong. That the App Store, as Apple wants it, is (a) good for users, (b) fair to developers, and (c) <em>competitive</em>, not anti-competitive, legally. But even if Apple is correct about that, at some point, after being handed loss after loss in rulings from courts and regulatory bodies around the globe, shouldn’t they change their strategy and start trying to offer their own concessions, rather than wait for bureaucrat-designed concessions to be forced upon them?</p>

<p>However Apple thinks all of this <em>should</em> work out is not the way it <em>is</em> working out. The best time to adjust the rules of the App Store — its exclusivity on app distribution for the entire iOS platform, the exclusivity of Apple’s IAP for purchasing digital content, the commission percentage splits on IAP — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut">was over a decade ago</a>. The next best time to make those adjustments is now.</p>

<p>I took the above photo on Monday, June 9, <a href="https://glass.photo/gruber/series/2skCCKMH4LYm8HAuxeoMHo-wwdc-2025-apple-park">this year at WWDC</a>. Keynote day, around 1:30pm PT. I captured it using my iPhone 16 Pro and <a href="https://notbor.ing/product/camera">Not Boring’s !Camera app</a>, using the built-in Mono Tokyo LUT. Like the other apps in Not Boring’s growing suite, !Camera can be mistaken by the too-cynical as a toy. It is fun and colorful, and some of its features exist for the sake of fun alone. But, just like Not Boring’s other offerings (my favorites: <a href="https://notbor.ing/product/weather">!Weather</a>, <a href="https://notbor.ing/product/calculator">!Calculator</a>, and <a href="https://notbor.ing/product/habits">!Habits</a>), it’s a genuinely serious tool. And of the bunch, I think !Camera is the most innovative. The fact that it’s fun makes me want to use it — a vastly underestimated attribute of tool design. <a href="https://notbor.ing/product/camera">From Not Boring’s website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go from snap to sharing without any editing. !Camera is the first
camera app to enable professional-level color grading with 3D LUTs
(“lookup tables”) used in high-end workflows by pro photographers
to achieve realistic film simulations and unique cinematic looks.
Use !Camera’s designed presets, add LUTs from your favorite
creators, or make and import your own! New Styles and
collaborations released every season.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>!Camera <em>looks</em> gimmicky but I assure you it’s not — and what might strike you as gimmicky is really just plain fun and whimsical. My affection for it, and my use of it, has grown, not shrunk, as the months have gone by. While my hardware Camera Control buttons (plural, as I’m currently testing multiple iPhones) remain set to open Apple’s own Camera app, which I continue to use by default, I keep !Camera’s simple widget on my iPhones’ Lock Screens to launch it quickly after unpocketing my iPhone.</p>

<p>!Camera’s use of LUTs for filter-like effects opens the app to a wide world of non-proprietary looks. The best source I’ve found for new LUTs to import is the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/panasonic-lumix-lab/id6499262377">Panasonic LUMIX Lab</a> app — Panasonic’s built-in LUTs are boring, but the app has a whole community of user-submitted LUTs and I’ve found several of them that are lovely. !Camera’s custom “SuperRAW” format, is, in my opinion, key to the appeal of the app:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No more flat lifeless photos, no AI processing, no weird
artifacts. Our SuperRaw™ photo processing has been crafted to
showcase more film-like tones and preserve a photo’s beautiful
natural grain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than fighting the nature of the small (and thus, noisy) sensors in the iPhone camera systems, SuperRAW processing embraces the noise, imbuing images with <a href="https://x.com/asallen/status/1947321942127845853">natural-looking grain</a>. The results, to my eyes, are genuinely film-like. If you want, you can configure !Camera to save a raw DNG file alongside each capture, for post-processing in an app like Darkroom, Lightroom, or Photoshop. I’m glad that option is there, but I just shoot in SuperRAW, which saves ready-to-share HEIC files with the LUT applied in my camera roll, so what I see is what I get.</p>

<p>Each of Not Boring’s apps is available for a $15/year subscription, but the way to go is <a href="https://notbor.ing/plans">Not Boring’s $50/year “Super !Boring” subscription</a>, which grants you a license to their entire suite of apps. I was already a Super !Boring subscriber when !Camera launched, so, effectively, I got it for free. $50/year isn’t nothing, but it’s not much, and subscriptions have proven to be the best monetization strategy for indie developers in today’s world.</p>

<h2>Project Indigo</h2>

<p>Marc Levoy, Adobe fellow, and Florian Kainz, principal scientist, <a href="https://research.adobe.com/articles/indigo/indigo.html">on the Adobe Research blog back in June</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second, people often complain about the “smartphone look” — overly
bright, low contrast, high color saturation, strong smoothing, and
strong sharpening. To some extent this look is driven by consumer
preference. It also makes photos easier to read on the small
screen and in bad lighting. But to the discerning photographer, or
anybody who views these photos on a larger screen than a phone,
they may look unrealistic. [...]</p>

<p>What’s different about computational photography using Indigo?
First, we under-expose more strongly than most cameras. Second, we
capture, align, and combine more frames when producing each photo — up to 32 frames as in the example above. This means that our
photos have fewer blown-out highlights and less noise in the
shadows. Taking a photo with our app may require slightly more
patience after pressing the shutter button than you’re used to,
but after a few seconds you’ll be rewarded with a better picture.</p>

<p>As a side benefit of these two strategies, we need less spatial
denoising (i.e. smoothing) than most camera apps. This means we
preserve more natural textures. In fact, we bias our processing
towards minimal smoothing, even if this means leaving a bit of
noise in the photo. You can see these effects in the example
photos later in this article.</p>

<p>One more thing. Many of our users prefer to shoot raw, not JPEGs,
and they want these raw images to benefit from computational
photography. (Some big cameras offer the ability to capture
bursts of images and combine them in-camera, but they output a
JPEG, not a raw file.) Indigo can output JPEG or raw files that
benefit equally from the computational photography strategy
outlined here. [...]</p>

<p>In reaction to the prevailing smartphone look, some camera apps
advertise “zero-process” photography. In fact, the pixels read
from a digital sensor must be processed to create a recognizable
image. This processing includes at a minimum white balancing,
color correction to account for the different light sensitivity of
the red, green and blue pixels, and demosaicing to create a
full-color image. Based on our conversations with photographers,
what they really want is not zero-process but a more natural look — more like what an SLR might produce. To accomplish this, our
photos employ only mild tone mapping, boosting of color
saturation, and sharpening. We do perform semantically-aware
mask-based adjustments, but only subtle ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may recognize Levoy’s name. After a distinguished career <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~levoy/">at Stanford teaching computer science</a>, Levoy spent 2014 to 2020 leading the computational photography team at Google <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h7Is5MA3Ng">for their highly-regarded-as-cameras Pixel phones</a>. In 2020 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/07/20/levoy-adobe">Levoy left Google for Adobe</a>, and Indigo is one of the first fruits of his time there.</p>

<p>Allison Johnson of The Verge — notably, she came to The Verge by way of <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/">DPReview</a> — wrote a splendid piece on Indigo shortly after the app debuted, under the headline “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/694014/adobe-project-indigo-camera-app-hands-on-hdr">Adobe’s New Camera App Is Making Me Rethink Phone Photography</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you hate the overly aggressive HDR look, or you’re tired of
your iPhone sharpening the ever-living crap out of your photos,
Project Indigo might be for you. It’s available in beta on iOS,
though it is <em>not</em> — and I stress this — for the faint of heart.
It’s slow, it’s prone to heating up my iPhone, and it drains the
battery. But it’s the most thoughtfully designed camera experience
I’ve ever used on a phone, and it gave me a renewed sense of
curiosity about the camera I use every day.</p>

<p>You’ll know this isn’t your garden-variety camera app right from
the onboarding screens. One section details the difference between
two histograms available to use with the live preview image (one
is based on Indigo’s own processing and one is based on Apple’s
image pipeline). Another line describes the way the app handles
processing of subjects and skies as “special (but gentle).” This
is a camera nerd’s love language.</p>

<p>Slow and battery-draining is exactly why Apple hasn’t pursued these sorts of advanced computational photography techniques in the built-in Camera app. Apple’s Camera app is super-fast and takes extraordinary effort to go easy on the battery. Apple is making entirely different trade-offs — correctly — for the default Camera app. Pro and prosumer photographers may want to make completely different trade-offs when it comes to image processing time and energy.<sup id="fnr1-2025-10-21"><a href="#fn1-2025-10-21">1</a></sup> (For the last few years, Apple has shot its keynote events using iPhone cameras exclusively, but they use apps like <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagiccamera">Blackmagic Camera</a>, not the built-in Camera app, to shoot them.)</p>

<p>I’m deeply intrigued by Indigo, and I have a few friends who’ve shown me some extraordinary photographs taken with the app. If they hadn’t told me, I’d have wagered their photos were taken with dedicated large-sensor digital cameras, not phones. Johnson described Indigo as “not for the faint of heart”, and I’m just faint-hearted — or perhaps lazy — enough that, when venturing to a third-party camera app during the past few months, I’ve reached for !Camera, not Indigo, mainly because I don’t want to bother with any sort of manual post-processing for any but my very favorite of favorite images. But Indigo — available <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/project-indigo/id6742591546">free of charge from the App Store</a> — is well worth your attention.<sup id="fnr2-2025-10-21"><a href="#fn2-2025-10-21">2</a></sup> I hope it’s an app that Adobe is serious about maintaining and developing into the future.</p>

<p>Johnson also interviewed Levoy last month on The Vergecast. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQI6G0cbZKY&amp;t=1822s">The interview starts at 30m:22s</a>.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-10-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<p>Indigo is currently iOS-only, but <a href="https://research.adobe.com/articles/indigo/indigo.html">in their introductory blog post</a>, Levoy and Kainz write: “What’s next for Project Indigo? An Android version for sure. We’d also like to add alternative ‘looks’, maybe even personalized ones. We also plan to add a portrait mode, but with more control and higher image quality than existing camera apps, as well as panorama and video recording, including some cool computational video features we’re cooking up in the lab.” Also worth noting: Indigo’s computational photography is so tied to specific hardware that it <a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/lightroom-ecosystem-cloud-based-discussions/p-introducing-the-project-indigo-camera-app/m-p/15513112#M108265">doesn’t yet support</a> any of the iPhones 17 nor the iPhone Air.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2025-10-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<p>Some thoughts and observations:</p>

<h2>14-Inch MacBook Pro</h2>

<p>Apple Newsroom: “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unveils-new-14-inch-macbook-pro-powered-by-the-m5-chip/">Apple Unveils New 14‑Inch MacBook Pro Powered by the M5 Chip, Delivering the Next Big Leap in AI for the Mac</a>”.</p>

<p>The 14-inch MacBook Pro with the no-adjective M-series chip has always been an odd duck in the MacBook lineup. This “Pro”-but-not-pro spot in the MacBook lineup goes back to the Intel era, when there was a 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar. That was the MacBook Pro that, in 2016, Phil Schiller suggested as <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/new-macbook-pro-should-have-been-named-air/">a good choice for those who were then holding out for a MacBook Air with a retina display</a>. (The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111933">first retina MacBook Air</a> didn’t ship for another two years, in late 2018.) It’s more like a MacBook “Pro” than a MacBook Pro. The truly <em>pro</em>-spec’d MacBook Pros have M-series Pro and Max chips, and are available in both 14- and 16-inch sizes. The base 14-inch model, with the no-adjective M-series chip, is for people who probably would be better served with a MacBook Air but who wrongly believe they “need” a laptop with “Pro” in its name.</p>

<p>Here’s a timeline of no-adjective M-series chips and when they appeared in the 14-inch MacBook Pro:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>M1 13-inch MacBook Pro: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/introducing-the-next-generation-of-mac/">10 November 2020</a>. This MacBook Pro was one of the three Macs that debuted with the launch of Apple Silicon — the others were the MacBook Air and Mac Mini. The hardware looked exactly like the last generation Intel MacBook Pro. The M1 Pro and M1 Max models didn’t ship for another year (well, 11 months later), and those models brought with them the new form factor design that’s still with us today with the new M5 MacBook Pro.</p></li>
<li><p>M2 13-inch MacBook Pro: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/06/apple-unveils-m2-with-breakthrough-performance-and-capabilities/">6 June 2022</a>. This model also stuck with the older Intel-era form factor, including the 13-inch, not 14-inch, display size.</p></li>
<li><p>M3 14-inch MacBook Pro: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-new-macbook-pro-featuring-m3-chips/">30 October 2023</a>. The “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast-apples-keynote-event-shot-on-iphone/">Scary Fast</a>” event. This model debuted alongside the pro-spec’d M3 Pro and M3 Max 14- and 16-inch models.</p></li>
<li><p>M4 14-inch MacBook Pro: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/new-macbook-pro-features-m4-family-of-chips-and-apple-intelligence/">30 October 2024</a>. Exactly one year after the M3, and also alongside the M4 Pro and M4 Max models. What was different in 2024 with the M4 generation is that <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-stunning-new-ipad-pro-with-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-pro/">the M4 iPad Pros debuted back in early May</a>, all by themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>M5 14-inch MacBook Pro: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unveils-new-14-inch-macbook-pro-powered-by-the-m5-chip/">15 October 2025</a> (today). What’s different with today’s announcement is that it is <em>not</em> alongside the M5 Pro and M5 Max models, but <em>is</em> alongside the M5 iPad Pros.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This raises the question of when to expect those M5 Pro/Max models. The rumor mill suggests “early 2026”. I suspect that’s right, based on nothing other than the fact that if they were going to be announced this year, Apple almost certainly would have announced the entire M5 generation MacBook lineup together.</p>

<p>Basically, this is just a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/compare/?modelList=MacBook-Pro-14-M5,MacBook-Pro-14-M4,MacBook-Pro-14-M4-Pro">speed bump upgrade over the just-plain M4 MacBook Pro</a>. But annual — or at least regular — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/05/good_old_fashioned_macbook_pro_speed_bumps">speed bumps are a good thing</a>. The alternative is years-long gaps between hardware refreshes.</p>

<h2>iPad Pros</h2>

<p>Apple Newsroom: “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-introduces-the-powerful-new-ipad-pro-with-the-m5-chip/">Apple Introduces the Powerful New iPad Pro With the M5 Chip</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Featuring a next-generation GPU with a Neural Accelerator in each
core, M5 delivers a big boost in performance for iPad Pro users,
whether they’re working on cutting-edge projects or tapping into
AI for productivity. The new iPad Pro delivers up to 3.5× the AI
performance than iPad Pro with M4 and up to 5.6× faster than iPad
Pro with M1. N1, the new Apple-designed wireless networking chip,
enables the latest generation of wireless technologies with
support for Wi-Fi 7 on iPad Pro. The C1X modem comes to cellular
models of iPad Pro, delivering up to 50 percent faster cellular
data performance than its predecessor with even greater
efficiency, allowing users to do more on the go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the N1 wireless chip and C1X modem are more interesting generation-over-generation improvements than the M5 chip. Thanks to the N1, these iPad Pro models support Wi-Fi 7 — today’s new M5 14-inch MacBook Pro does not. I would wager rather heavily that the upcoming M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro models <em>will</em> support Wi-Fi 7 (probably via the N1 chip, or perhaps even an “N1X” or something).</p>

<p>Other than that, this too <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/?modelList=ipad-pro-11-m5,ipad-pro-11-m4,ipad-air-11-m3">is a speed bump upgrade</a>.</p>

<h2>Vision Pro</h2>

<p>Apple Newsroom: “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-vision-pro-upgraded-with-the-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band/">Apple Vision Pro Upgraded With the M5 Chip and Dual Knit Band</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The upgraded Vision Pro also comes with the soft, cushioned Dual
Knit Band to help users achieve an even more comfortable fit, and
visionOS 26, which unlocks innovative spatial experiences,
including widgets, new Personas, an interactive Jupiter
Environment, and new Apple Intelligence features with support for
additional languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new Dual Knit Band (<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/DUAL_KNIT_BAND_SA/apple-vision-pro-dual-knit-band">$99 on its own</a>) looks like a hybrid of the more attractive Solo Knit Band (which did not have a strap that went over the top of your head) and the Dual Loop Band (which did have an over-the-head strap, but which looked somewhat orthopedic). It’s a tacit acknowledgement that physical comfort has been a real problem for many people who’ve tried Vision Pro. (Me, personally, I find using it with the Solo Knit Band comfortable for as long as I care to use it — which is typically just 2–3 hours, tops.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are over 1 million apps and thousands of games on the App
Store, hundreds of 3D movies on the Apple TV app, and all-new
series and films in Apple Immersive with a selection of live NBA
games coming soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Translation: <em>Hey, there’s actually a growing library of immersive content to watch, software to use, and games to play for this thing now.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With M5, Apple Vision Pro renders 10 percent more pixels on the
custom micro-OLED displays compared to the previous generation,
resulting in a sharper image with crisper text and more detailed
visuals. Vision Pro can also increase the refresh rate up to 120Hz
for reduced motion blur when users look at their physical
surroundings, and an even smoother experience when using Mac
Virtual Display. Vision Pro with M5 works alongside the
purpose-built R1 chip, which processes input from 12 cameras, five
sensors, and six microphones, and streams new images to the
displays within 12 milliseconds to create a real-time view of the
world. The high-performance battery now supports up to two and a
half hours of general use, and up to three hours of video
playback, all on a single charge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s merely another speed bump upgrade alongside the other two speed bump upgrades today, but a bit more dramatic given that the Vision Pro is jumping from the M2 to M5. No price drop, no change to the form factor. But Apple’s interest in the platform is very much alive.</p>

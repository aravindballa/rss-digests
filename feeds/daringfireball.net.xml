<p>Mark Tyson at Tom’s Hardware:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AOL, now a Yahoo property, will end its dial-up internet service,
the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)-based internet
connectivity service, <a href="https://help.aol.com/articles/dial-up-internet-to-be-discontinued">on September 30, 2025</a>. Its dial-up service
has been publicly available for 34 years, and has provided many an
internet surfer’s first taste of the WWW. AOL will also end its
AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser. RIP slowband.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/757194/aol-dial-up-is-dead">Thomas Ricker at The Verge</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might be surprised that the service was still operating. I’m
not. At last count, a 2019 <a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2019.B28011?q=ACSDT1Y2019.B28011&amp;hidePreview=true">US census</a> estimated that 265,000
people in the United States were still using dial-up internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unsurprisingly, I never used AOL, but, I of course did use dial-up service to access the Internet. First for a few years while still a student at Drexel, then through some sort of commercial service here in Philadelphia. I forget the name of the company. But I do remember using <a href="https://www.sustworks.com/site/prod_ipr_overview.html">IPNetRouter</a>, a terrific classic Mac utility by Peter Sichel/Sustainable Softworks that allowed you to share a dial-up connection with your LAN. (Amazingly, the Sustainable Softworks website is still up, seemingly unchanged for decades.)</p>

<p>So when my now-wife and I moved in together in 1999, I set up a LAN connecting our Macs and my HP LaserJet. My Mac was connected to a modem, which used a second phone line that was just for Internet access. When either of our Macs tried to access the Internet, IPNetRouter, running all the time on my <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powermac/specs/powermac_9600_350.html">PowerMac 9600/350</a>, would initiate a dial-up connection that both of us could use at the same time. It felt like a pretty nifty setup.</p>

<p>I don’t recall when we first got a broadband connection — DSL for a few years, then cable — but I’m thinking it might have been as early as 2000 or 2001. It certainly wasn’t too long after that. So I think I only ever used dial-up modems for six or seven years. Maybe eight years, tops. But in hindsight those years feel like an entire era of my life. Those connections were just breathtakingly slow. But slow, finicky Internet service in your home was infinitely more amazing and fun and useful than what we were all used to — which was not having any sort of online connectivity at all. We all knew what it was like to have “real” Internet speeds in buildings on our college campuses or, for some of us, in offices where we went to work. So we knew that even the fastest dial-up connection was painfully slow. But we made do. Software was designed to treat bandwidth — each and every request — as a precious, limited resource. It was a deliberate choice, by you, the user, to “go online” to, say, check and send email. Developers took pains to make their apps as small as possible, because downloading even a few megabytes could take a while. Websites eschewed bloat, because if a website was bloated, no one would bother going there. In some ways, overall, things were better because the technology was so much worse. My nostalgia for that era is quite profound — exemplified, of course, by my affection for the distinctive grating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVkWE2AQvgA">sound of a modem initiating its connection</a>.</p>

<p>A list of various related news items and clips from this, and recent, weeks:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Apple Newsroom, on Wednesday — “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/08/apple-increases-us-commitment-to-600-billion-usd-announces-ambitious-program/">Apple Increases U.S. Commitment
To $600 Billion, Announces American Manufacturing Program</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced a new $100 billion commitment to America, a
significant acceleration of its U.S. investment that now totals
$600 billion over the next four years. Today’s announcement
includes the ambitious new American Manufacturing Program (AMP),
dedicated to bringing even more of Apple’s supply chain and
advanced manufacturing to the U.S. Through AMP, Apple will
increase its investment across America and incentivize global
companies to manufacture even more critical components in the
United States.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Separately, also from Apple Newsroom Wednesday — “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/08/apple-corning-to-manufacture-all-iphone-apple-watch-cover-glass-in-kentucky/">Apple and Corning Partner to Manufacture 100 Percent of iPhone and Apple Watch Cover Glass in Kentucky</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple and Corning today announced a major expansion of their
long-standing partnership to make precision glass for Apple
products. Apple is making a new $2.5 billion commitment to produce
all of the cover glass for iPhone and Apple Watch in Corning’s
Harrodsburg, Kentucky, manufacturing facility. This means that 100
percent of the cover glass on iPhone and Apple Watch units sold
worldwide will be made in the U.S. for the first time.</p>

<p>Corning is creating the world’s largest and most advanced
smartphone glass production line at the Harrodsburg facility.
Corning will now dedicate this entire facility to manufacturing
for Apple, which will help increase Corning’s manufacturing and
engineering workforce in Kentucky by 50 percent.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>From inside the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9DrCgWtOUw">a 3.5-minute video of Trump’s introductory remarks, then Tim Cook giving Trump a trophy of sorts</a>, with an Apple-logo top made from glass produced at the Corning facility in Kentucky, and a base made from 24-karat gold (perhaps left over from Apple’s decade ago foray into $20,000 “Edition” Apple Watches?).</p>

<p>This video is one of the most pathetic things I’ve ever witnessed, for everyone involved. (Note Cook’s awkward laughter when Trump, after claiming that “about $17 trillion is coming into the United States” thanks to the brilliance of his economic statecraft, quips “That’s even a lot of money for you”, looking at Cook.)</p></li>
<li><p>From the same press event in the Oval Office, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86PacdFT4o4">a 5-minute video of Cook’s benign but obsequious prepared remarks</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple’s stock, as I type this after the close of markets on Friday, is up 11.6 percent for the week, and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-jumps-5-1-100-121100958.html">jumped over 5 percent</a> immediately after Wednesday’s announcements.</p></li>
<li><p>Tripp Mickle, reporting for The New York Times back on May 26, under the headline “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/technology/techs-trump-whisperer-tim-cook-goes-quiet-as-his-influence-fades.html">Tech’s Trump Whisperer, Tim Cook, Goes Quiet as His Influence Fades</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the run-up to President Trump’s recent trip to the Middle East,
the White House encouraged chief executives and representatives of
many U.S. companies to join him. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief
executive, declined, said two people familiar with the decision.
The choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump. As he hopscotched from
Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Trump took a number
of shots at Mr. Cook.</p>

<p>During his speech in Riyadh, Mr. Trump paused to praise Jensen
Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, for traveling to the Middle
East along with the White House delegation. Then he knocked Mr.
Cook. “I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here but you are,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj1QOz3iuCE">Mr. Trump
said</a> to Mr. Huang at an event attended by chief executives
like Larry Fink of the asset manager BlackRock, Sam Altman of
OpenAI, Jane Fraser of Citigroup and Lisa Su of the semiconductor
company AMD.</p>

<p>Later in Qatar, Mr. Trump said he “had a little problem with
Tim Cook.” The president praised Apple’s investment in the
United States, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-zbId7W7IA">said he had told Mr. Cook</a>, “But
now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you
building in India.”</p>

<p>On Friday morning, Mr. Trump caught much of his own
administration and Apple’s leadership off guard with <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114556874484491575">a social
media post</a> threatening tariffs of 25 percent on iPhones
made anywhere except the United States. The post thrust Apple
back into the administration’s cross hairs a little over a month
after Mr. Cook had lobbied and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/technology/trump-electronics-tariffs.html">won an exemption</a> from a
145 percent tariff on iPhones assembled in China and sold in the
United States.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>April 2018: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Tim Cook in Cupertino, including a tour of Apple Park. From a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-crown-prince-visits-apple-google-2018-4">Kif Leswing report for Business Insider regarding the tour</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The young prince, often referred to as MBS, was on a charm
offensive, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/world/middleeast/saudi-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-us.html">according to The New York Times</a>. His goal was
to change the Western perspective of Saudi Arabia as a
conservative country dependent on oil money where women are
treated as second-class people. Instead, Prince Mohammed wants
Americans to see Saudi Arabia as a modern country with extensive
investments in growth markets like technology.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>October 2018: Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and public critic of the Saudi regime, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/world/assassination-of-jamal-khashoggi-documentary/">was brutally assassinated</a> — literally chopped to pieces — inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Within weeks, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">the CIA concluded that Mohammed bin Salman had ordered the assassination</a>. Tim Cook has not met with MBS since.</p></li>
<li><p>President Trump, at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in May — one stop among several on the Middle East tour, which, per point #6 above, Tim Cook declined to attend — was effusive in his praise and admiration for bin Salman. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-heaps-praise-saudi-crown-prince-touts-economic/story?id=121758613">Per ABC News</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Donald Trump spent the bulk of what was billed as a
“major foreign policy address” to outline his vision for the
Middle East instead touting his domestic policies and heaping
praise on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman while speaking at
the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Four years after the U.S. intelligence community report was
released that concluded that the crown prince approved the
assassination of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-raised-khashoggi-murder-saudi-crown-orince/story?id=86884105">Washington Post journalist Jamal
Khashoggi</a>, Trump lauded the crown prince for his leadership
and friendship.</p>

<p>“He’s your greatest representative, greatest representative. And
if I didn’t like him, I’d get out of here so fast. You know that,
don’t you? He knows me well. I do — I like him a lot. I like him
too much. That’s why we give so much, you know? Too much. I like
you too much,” Trump said while speaking in Saudi Arabia.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Trump, this week, at the White House event with Tim Cook, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/trump-tariffs-chips-companies.html">per CNBC</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We’re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and
semiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday
afternoon.</p>

<p>“But the good news for companies like Apple is if you’re building
in the United States or have committed to build, without question,
committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge.
So in other words, we’ll be putting a tariff on of approximately
100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you’re building in the
United States of America, there’s no charge.” [...]</p>

<p>But specifics about the plan, such as how much U.S. manufacturing
a company needs to do in order to qualify for the tariff
exemption, were not immediately clear.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>There is, of course, no need to wait for “specifics about the plan”, which almost certainly won’t ever be put in writing. We all know how to qualify for an exemption — it’s up to the whims of Trump. Thumbs up, you’re exempt. Thumbs down, you pay.</p>

<hr />

<p>So, what to make of Cook’s obsequious praise for Trump and gifting of an Apple-branded gold trophy? Your take may well be that Cook is simply now a Trump supporter. Or, your take may be that eating a big shit sandwich like this, right in the Oval Office, is simply what Cook “has to do”.</p>

<p>My take <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/04/consider-cook-as-a-tragic-figure">remains</a> somewhere in the middle, but closer to the latter than the former. Did Cook <em>have</em> to do this? No. Could the announcement that Apple was accelerating its investment plans for US manufacturing from $500 billion to $600 billion simply have been made via a press release on Apple Newsroom, rather than a made-for-TV press event in the Oval Office? Yes.<sup id="fnr1-2025-08-08"><a href="#fn1-2025-08-08">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But Cook, and Apple, need to pick their battles. To me, what’s obvious is the power dynamic. We’re not used to considering Apple, a $3 trillion company, as subservient in any relationship. But the US federal government dwarfs even the biggest of companies, and Trump is wielding the powers of the executive branch and the bully pulpit of the presidency in unprecedented ways. Flagrantly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/business/trump-tariffs-blocked-federal-court.html">illegal</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/12/nx-s1-5395696/qatar-trump-plane-gift-ethics">unethical</a> ways, but nonetheless, he’s wielding those powers. No company, no matter how big, can stand as a check or balance to that power.</p>

<p>It’s not even a case of “<em>kiss the ring and receive preferential treatment</em>”. It’s more a case of “<em>kiss his ass or else you’ll face punishment</em>”. Trump, like a perverted Santa Claus, keeps only two lists: naughty and nice. Cook and Apple got a taste of that after Cook declined to participate in Trump’s Middle East tour, leading Trump to reflexively declare new tariffs on iPhones assembled in India. Trump offered another taste when he announced this week, with Tim Cook in the room, the supposed 100 percent tariffs on computer chips for companies who aren’t playing ball. (I say <em>supposed</em> because <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/22/1256040785/trump-taco-wall-street-stock-market-tariffs">the TACO hypothesis</a>, thus far, has panned out.)</p>

<p>Faulting Cook for playing ball and kissing Trump’s ring (among <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder">other things</a>) is like faulting a local business for paying into a protection racket — one in which the cops are complicit, and the whole scam exists at the behest of a crooked mayor. Moral rectitude can feel good, but not so much when the cops are burning your store to the ground. There is no authority to appeal to for help when the highest office in the country is running the protection racket.</p>

<p>I don’t know what would happen to Apple if they simply refused to play ball with any of this at all. <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2025/08/03/trumps-puts-switzerland-in-trade-war-crossfire/">Targeted spiteful tariffs</a>, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/198818/pam-bondi-obama-grand-jury-authoritarian">bogus investigations</a> by the Justice Department, personal <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/08/07/trump-turns-the-screws-on-the-fortune-500-00498762">vilification in MAGA media</a>. Could Apple weather such a storm, financially, with its head held high? Probably. But to what effect? It wouldn’t change the game. The game is currently shamelessly corrupted.</p>

<p>Did Cook’s Oval Office display of fealty and his grotesque golden gift make you feel something? Did it engender an emotional response? Grossed out, perhaps? A little sick? Angry? Offended? Me too. But did you feel good — reassured? proud? — when Cook skipped that Middle East Trump tour in May? You know, the one that ranged from Trump singing the praises of the murderous Mohammed bin Salman (“I like you too much”) to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy5lp4v594o">accepting as a gift</a> (that he claims will wind up in the possession of his post-presidential “library”) a 747 luxury jet from Qatar.</p>

<p>If you choose to believe that Tim Cook is weak, unethical, greedy, or even — despite <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/news/klan-mlk-bobby-kennedy-inspired-apple-ceo-tim-cook">his long-professed heroes</a> — secretly a MAGA supporter, there’s likely nothing I can say to disabuse you of the notion. You can’t prove a negative. But I would argue that that line of cynicism is the easy way out. That you’re taking comfort in directing your ire at Cook, and the notion that if Cook had more backbone he’d refuse to play this game. It’s comforting to believe it’s him and his ilk, greedy selfish billionaires, not us as a collective whole.</p>

<p>It is disturbing to think that the leader of a beloved, trusted, and widely believed-to-be-ethical company like Apple has succumbed to avarice. That Tim Cook feels no qualms about — or perhaps even delights in — participating in a quid-pro-quo-driven corrupt administration in which flattery, fealty, gifts, and barely-concealed bribes are rewarded. That the United States devolving into kleptocracy suits Tim Cook just fine, because Apple’s pockets are deep enough to pay the vig.</p>

<p>But the alternative is more disturbing.</p>

<p>What if Tim Cook is, in fact, strong, proud, and driven by a keen sense of moral and ethical clarity? Perhaps Cook declined Trump’s invitation to join his Middle East entourage in May only because he was otherwise busy. But I believe there are bridges he will not cross — and that trip, especially its implicit and explicit praise and sanctification of the Saudi regime in general, and MBS in particular, was one of them. The whole trip was grotesque, and made a mockery of traditional American values.</p>

<p>US manufacturing, on the other hand, is a point of genuine alignment between Trump’s desires and Apple’s interests and ethics. Emphasizing that alignment in an Oval Office event, solid gold trophy in hand, is gross, yes, but not at all a corruption of anything Cook believes to be in the genuine interests of Apple or the nation. Consider the possibility that, far from being comfortable with his gift and obsequious ring-kissing this week, Cook was as discomfited by it as anyone. That he is keenly aware that trust and reputation are only accrued slowly, but are always at risk of being squandered quickly, and that this applies both to how he is perceived personally and how Apple is perceived as an institution — a pillar of American ingenuity and industry. His life’s work. And that despite all of that, Cook concluded that debasing himself, selling some shares of his own dignity, was the best course of action — for Apple, for Apple’s customers (and, yes, shareholders), and perhaps even for the country. That <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/04/consider-cook-as-a-tragic-figure">ruthless practicality</a> is necessary merely to stay afloat in a sea of abject graft, extortion, and cronyism. That’s dark. That requires considering that the problem isn’t the greed of a few billionaires and executives who ought to resist burgeoning corruption, but that Trump and his sycophants in the Republican Party <em>have already succeeded in corrupting the system</em>. That the corruption isn’t <em>happening</em>, but <em>happened</em>. The United States isn’t heading for existential trouble. We’re in it — and a pathway out is not yet clear. That’s not to say all is forever lost, but that we are, in our current political moment, beyond the point where the game can be played successfully on the level. You can choose to play a crooked game straight, but you can’t win. Business is competition. A loser who played above reproach is still a loser. You need to choose your battles. US manufacturing is Cook’s choice.</p>

<p>The White House has long been called <a href="https://www.whitehousehistory.org/videos/the-peoples-house">the People’s House</a>. The embarrassment of this week’s Oval Office bending of the knee isn’t Cook’s or Apple’s alone. It’s an embarrassment for our entire nation. It’s not him. It’s not them. It’s us.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1-2025-08-08">
<p>Also worth noting: Apple’s investment plan for US manufacturing is largely in line with their $430 billion plan four years ago at the outset of the Biden administration, and is likely what they’d be committing under a hypothetical Harris administration or second Biden term. Apple’s strategy hasn’t wavered on this front; only the fanfare has.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-08-08"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<p>OpenAI:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re releasing gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b — two
state-of-the-art open-weight language models that deliver strong
real-world performance at low cost. Available under the flexible
Apache 2.0 license, these models outperform similarly sized open
models on reasoning tasks, demonstrate strong tool use
capabilities, and are optimized for efficient deployment on
consumer hardware. They were trained using a mix of reinforcement
learning and techniques informed by OpenAI’s most advanced
internal models, including o3 and other frontier systems.</p>

<p>The gpt-oss-120b model achieves near-parity with OpenAI o4-mini on
core reasoning benchmarks, while running efficiently on a single
80 GB GPU. The gpt-oss-20b model delivers similar results to
OpenAI o3‑mini on common benchmarks and can run on edge devices
with just 16 GB of memory, making it ideal for on-device use
cases, local inference, or rapid iteration without costly
infrastructure. Both models also perform strongly on tool use,
few-shot function calling, CoT reasoning (as seen in results on
the Tau-Bench agentic evaluation suite) and HealthBench (even
outperforming proprietary models like OpenAI o1 and GPT‑4o).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/5/gpt-oss/">Simon Willison</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The long promised <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/5/gpt-oss/">OpenAI open weight models are here</a>, and
they are <em>very</em> impressive. [...]</p>

<p>o4-mini and o3-mini are <em>really good</em> proprietary models — I was
not expecting the open weights releases to be anywhere near that
class, especially given their small sizes. That gpt-oss-20b model
should run quite comfortably on a Mac laptop with 32GB of RAM.</p>

<p>Anthropic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GitHub notes that Claude Opus 4.1 improves across most
capabilities relative to Opus 4, with particularly notable
performance gains in multi-file code refactoring. Rakuten Group
finds that Opus 4.1 excels at pinpointing exact corrections within
large codebases without making unnecessary adjustments or
introducing bugs, with their team preferring this precision for
everyday debugging tasks. Windsurf reports Opus 4.1 delivers a one
standard deviation improvement over Opus 4 on their junior
developer benchmark, showing roughly the same performance leap as
the jump from Sonnet 3.7 to Sonnet 4.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing spectacular here, but incremental improvements add up. Mike Krieger — best known as a co-founder of Instagram, now chief product officer at Anthropic — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-05/anthropic-unveils-more-powerful-model-ahead-of-gpt-5-release?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NDQxMTg0NCwiZXhwIjoxNzU1MDE2NjQ0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMEo0SVdHUFdDTDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFODA3NUYyRkZGMjA0NUI2QTlEQzA5M0EyQTdEQTE4NiJ9.ZBaEbfLOztvlCdvvpJohLjqYRA-XcYxKD80FPmhsXjo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">in an interview with Bloomberg</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the past, we were too focused on only shipping the really big
upgrades,” said Anthropic Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger.
“It’s better at coding, better at reasoning, better at agentic
tasks. We’re just making it better for people.” [...]</p>

<p>“One thing I’ve learned, especially in AI as it’s moving quickly,
is that we can focus on what we have — and what other folks are
going to do is ultimately up to them,” Krieger said when asked
about OpenAI’s upcoming release. “We’ll see what ends up happening
on the OpenAI side, but for us, we really just focused on what can
we deliver for the customers we have.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m on board with the idea that Apple <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/05/apple-q3-results">need not acquire</a> any of these AI startups, but if they do, Anthropic — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/05/regarding-those-rumors-of-apple-pursuing-an-acquisition-of-perplexity">not Perplexity</a> — seems the one most aligned with Apple’s values. And I don’t mean <em>values</em> in just an ethical sense, but their entire approach to product development in general.</p>

<p>Ashley Belanger, writing for Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Porn sites may have blown up Meta’s key defense in a copyright
fight with book authors who earlier this year <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/meta-torrented-over-81-7tb-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-authors-say/">said that Meta
torrented</a> “at least 81.7 terabytes of data across multiple
shadow libraries” to train its AI models. [...]</p>

<p>After authors revealed Meta’s torrenting, Strike 3 Holdings
checked its proprietary BitTorrent-tracking tools designed to
detect infringement of its videos and alleged that the company
found evidence that Meta has been torrenting and seeding its
copyrighted content for years — since at least 2018. Some of the
IP addresses were clearly registered to Meta, while others
appeared to be “hidden,” and at least one was linked to a Meta
employee, the filing said.</p>

<p>According to Strike 3 Holdings, Meta “willfully and intentionally”
infringed “at least 2,396 movies” as part of a strategy to
download terabytes of data as fast as possible by seeding popular
high-quality porn. Supposedly, Meta continued seeding the content
“sometimes for days, weeks, or even months” after downloading
them, and these movies may also have been secretly used to train
Meta’s AI models, Strike 3 Holdings alleged.</p>

<p>The porn site operator explained to the court that BitTorrent’s
protocol establishes a “tit-for-tat” mechanism that “rewards users
who distribute the most desired content.” It alleged that Meta
took advantage of this system by “often” pirating adult videos
that are “often within the most infringed files on BitTorrent
websites” on “the very same day the motion pictures are released.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meta is an empty husk of a company with no values, no beliefs, other than growth and dominance for the sake of growth and dominance.</p>

<p>Ghost:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we <a href="https://ghost.org/changelog/5/">announced Ghost 5.0</a> a few years ago, we were proud
to share that Ghost’s revenue had hit $4M — while publisher
earnings had surpassed $10M. It felt great to have such a clear
sign that our goal to create a sustainable business model for
independent creators was succeeding.</p>

<p>Today, Ghost’s annual revenue is over $8.5M while total publisher
earnings on Ghost have now surpassed $100M. [...]</p>

<p>Unlike our venture-backed peers obsessed with growth at all costs,
we’re structured as a non-profit foundation that serves publishers
directly with open source software. We believe independent media
cannot be beholden to proprietary tech companies, so Ghost
publishers don’t just “own their email list” — they own the
entire software stack that underpins their business, end to end.</p>

<p>Not a centralized platform controlled by a single corporation, but
open infrastructure that’s shared by everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/substack">my feelings about Substack</a> — clearly the main target of Ghost’s shade-throwing here — it’s just great to see so many indie publishers and writers thriving on Ghost.</p>

<p>MacRumors, on June 20:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple executives have been discussing the possibility of the
company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-20/apple-executives-have-held-internal-talks-about-buying-ai-startup-perplexity">making a bid to acquire Perplexity AI</a>, according
to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Perplexity is one of the
leading AI startups that has proven popular as an AI-infused
web search engine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From that <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250620/p23#a250620p23">Bloomberg report by Gurman</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Adrian Perica, the company’s head of mergers and acquisitions, has
weighed the idea with services chief Eddy Cue and top AI
decision-makers, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The discussions are at an early stage and may not lead to an
offer, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
matter is private.</p>

<p>Such a deal would help Apple develop an AI-based search engine,
part of efforts to cope with the potential loss of a longstanding
arrangement with Google. That partnership, which involves making
Google the default browser on devices, generates roughly $20
billion a year for Apple — and is now under threat from US
antitrust enforcers.</p>

<p>To date, Apple executives haven’t discussed a bid with Perplexity
management. Bloomberg News reported earlier Friday that Meta
Platforms Inc. tried to buy Perplexity earlier this year.</p>

<p>“We have no knowledge of any current or future M&amp;A discussions
involving Perplexity,” the AI startup said in a statement. Apple
declined to comment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think, reading between the lines of Apple’s prepared remarks and Tim Cook’s and CFO Kevan Parekh’s answers to analyst questions last week after announcing quarterly earnings, that it doesn’t sound like they believe Apple needs to make a big acquisition in this space. Apple could probably acquire Perplexity for a lot less than it would cost to acquire other companies in the space, but that’s partly because Perplexity doesn’t develop or train its own models. Perplexity primarily puts up its own front end atop models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Google, and xAI. I really don’t see what buying Perplexity would gain Apple.</p>

<p>But even putting that aside, it just seems like Perplexity is sketchy. This whole thing where Cloudflare seemingly caught them redhanded ignoring robots.txt directives and masquerading their user-agent makes the company seem like a poor cultural fit for Apple. I can see why Meta, a company <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/29/meta-onavo-snapchat">without a moral compass</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/20/meta-perplexity-scale-ai-deal.html">approached Perplexity to sniff around</a> regarding an acquisition. That seems like a good cultural fit.</p>

<p>I can’t see why Apple would want to get involved with a company like this though. Gurman’s report makes it sound like his sources are inside Apple, but man, this “Apple + Perplexity” thing feels more like something Perplexity would be seeding than one that Apple executives would be leaking.</p>

<p>The Cloudflare blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are observing stealth crawling behavior from Perplexity, an
AI-powered answer engine. Although Perplexity initially crawls
from their declared user agent, when they are presented with a
network block, they appear to obscure their crawling identity in
an attempt to circumvent the website’s preferences. We see
continued evidence that Perplexity is repeatedly modifying their
user agent and changing their source <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/">ASNs</a> to hide their
crawling activity, as well as ignoring — or sometimes failing to
even fetch — <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-robots-txt/">robots.txt</a> files.</p>

<p>The Internet as we have known it for the past three decades is
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content-independence-day-no-ai-crawl-without-compensation/">rapidly changing</a>, but one thing remains constant: it is
built on trust. There are clear preferences that crawlers should
be transparent, serve a clear purpose, perform a specific
activity, and, most importantly, follow website directives and
preferences. Based on Perplexity’s observed behavior, which is
incompatible with those preferences, we have de-listed them as a
verified bot and added heuristics to our managed rules that block
this stealth crawling. [...]</p>

<p>Our multiple test domains explicitly prohibited all automated
access by specifying in robots.txt and had specific WAF rules that
blocked crawling from <a href="https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/bots">Perplexity’s public crawlers</a>. We
observed that Perplexity uses not only their declared user-agent,
but also a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome
on macOS when their declared crawler was blocked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/agents-or-bots-making-sense-of-ai-on-the-open-web">Perplexity has responded</a>, accusing Cloudflare of incompetence and publicity-seeking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because Cloudflare has conveniently obfuscated their methodology
and declined to answer questions helping our teams understand, we
can only narrow this down to two possible explanations.</p>

<ol>
<li>Cloudflare needed a clever publicity moment and we–their own
customer–happened to be a useful name to get them one.</li>
<li>Cloudflare fundamentally misattributed 3-6M daily requests from
BrowserBase’s automated browser service to Perplexity, a basic
traffic analysis failure that’s particularly embarrassing for a
company whose core business is understanding and categorizing
web traffic.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whichever explanation is the truth, the technical errors in
Cloudflare’s analysis aren’t just embarrassing — they’re
disqualifying. When you misattribute millions of requests, publish
completely inaccurate technical diagrams, and demonstrate a
fundamental misunderstanding of how modern AI assistants work,
you’ve forfeited any claim to expertise in this space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perplexity’s response makes it sound like Cloudflare just doesn’t get how leading-edge AI chatbots work, and what users expect of them. But going back to Cloudflare’s post, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-undeclared-crawlers-to-evade-website-no-crawl-directives/">they specifically cite OpenAI</a> as an exemplar in respecting the directives of website publishers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we ran the same test as outlined above with ChatGPT, we found
that ChatGPT-User fetched the robots file and stopped crawling
when it was disallowed. We did not observe follow-up crawls from
any other user agents or third party bots. When we removed the
disallow directive from the robots entry, but presented ChatGPT
with a block page, they again stopped crawling, and we saw no
additional crawl attempts from other user agents. Both of these
demonstrate the appropriate response to website owner preferences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And nothing in Perplexity’s response attempts to explain Cloudflare’s accusation that Perplexity is adopting a false generic user-agent when their own declared user-agents are disallowed. Seems shifty to me.</p>

<a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkbook/thinkbook-plus/thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-14-16-inch-intel/len101b0056">ThinkBook Plus Gen 6</a> can be, it’s far from a normal
computer. It’s a $3,300 laptop with a screen that expands from 14
inches to 16.7 inches at the push of a button.</p>

<p>Oh, and it’s actually good. Not just good, but <em>very</em> good. I
still can’t believe it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Di Benedetto, as you can see, is enthusiastic for the laptop. I think it’s a clever idea, but this first instance seems pretty compromised:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As with a foldable phone, you can see some creases and ripples in
the screen’s lower third — the part that rolls up — especially
at oblique angles. If I look closely while working on a
bright-white document, I can sometimes make out a faint shadowy
strip, but I rarely see it, even when staring at that spot. The
motorized screen takes about eight seconds to extend or retract,
and it’s no louder than the fans on an average gaming laptop.
People right near you in a quiet space will hear it, but even
ambient sounds like a TV in the background easily mask the motor.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jason Snell, at Six Colors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Thursday, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/">reported its third-quarter 2025 fiscal
results</a>. Revenue was $94 billion (a fiscal third-quarter
record), up 10% versus the year-ago quarter. Mac revenue was up
15%, iPhone revenue up 13%, and Services revenue up 13%. The
Wearables/Home/Accessories category was down 9% and iPad revenue
down 8%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See also: the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/07/this-is-tim-transcript-of-apples-q3-2025-financial-call/">transcript of the analyst call</a>, and <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/07/apple-accelerates-the-roadmap-and-ratchets-its-revenue/">a column Snell wrote on the results and call</a>.</p>

<p>Two notes from the analyst call and prepared remarks. First, Apple did, for the first time, acknowledge the risk that Judge Amit Mehta, when he issues his remedies in the <em>US v. Google</em> case, might ban Google from making traffic acquisition cost payments, which would cut off at least $20 billion per year in Apple’s revenue. But while Apple is acknowledging there’s a risk, they’re not giving any hint what they plan to do if that happens. From the call:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America:</strong> Hi, yes, thank you so much. Tim,
I know you said similar growth in Services and that’s predicated
with Google payments continuing. Is there any way for us to
dimensionalize or maybe just conceptually talk about maybe options
if the counter were to happen, if the payments were not allowed in
some way? What are some of the things that Apple could do given
that it is a significant chunk of profitability?</p>

<p><strong>Tim Cook:</strong> Yeah, Wamsi, I don’t really want to speculate on the
court ruling and how they would rule and what we would do as a
consequence of it.</p>

<p><strong>Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America:</strong> OK, I guess we’ll wait for that
ruling to come out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I guess we will.</p>

<p>Similarly, on AI strategy and which aspects Apple sees as commodities and which it deems as essential and proprietary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Krish Sankar, TD Cowen:</strong> Tim, I’m curious about your thoughts
on AI for edge devices. You know, there’s like some people who
think that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you see a
scenario where LLMs become a core part of your iOS, or is the SLM
the way to go, and how to think about evolution of edge devices in
a futuristic AI world, and is smartphone going to be the choice of
device? I’m curious your thoughts on it, broadly speaking.</p>

<p><strong>Tim Cook:</strong> The way that we look at AI is that it’s one of the
most profound technologies of our lifetime, and I think it will
affect all devices in a significant way. What pieces of the chain
are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn’t want to really
talk about today because that gives away some things on our
strategy, but I think it’s a good question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These quarterly calls are better than nothing, but when it comes to anything not in their prepared statements, Apple seldom reveals anything at all.</p>

<p>My thanks to Hello Weather for sponsoring last week at DF. Regular readers know that I am an inveterate aficionado of weather apps. I’m not really much of a meteorology nerd, but I’m a pedestrian in a city with widely varying seasons. But even more so, I find weather apps to be a true playground for UI design and the presentation of quantitative information. Different weather apps take very different approaches, and I find the differences fascinating.</p>

<p>I first recommended Hello Weather <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/30/hello-weather">back in 2021</a>, and it’s been in my regular rotation of weather apps ever since. Back at the beginning of summer when they booked the sponsorship for this week, I started using the new version 4.0 (now up to 4.1.4) as my daily driver. I love it. It even has one of my favorite features for hot humid summers — a preference to set “feels like” as the primary temperature display (including in places like widgets). Hello Weather remains, as ever, attractive and useful in its design. And it offers everything you want in an iOS weather app: widgets for the home screen and Lock Screen, a Watch app, notification options (precipitation, severe storms, morning/evening forecast reports), and, wow, a veritable slew of forecast data providers to choose from.</p>

<p>Hello Weather’s privacy story is perfect: they collect zero user data, have no tracking or ads, and <a href="https://helloweather.com/privacy">their privacy policy</a> is written by humans for humans.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hello-weather/id978393692">download Hello Weather</a> and start a 7-day free trial.</p>

	<summary type="text">I firmly believe one could build a very nice business taking 10 percent of subscription revenue for a blogging/newsletter platform, if you could get as nice a roster of popular writers to build on the platform as Substack has. I do not think that’s a $1 billion business, though.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>One last post on my recent Substack kick. Yesterday <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/02/cox-substack" title="Daring Fireball: “Ana Marie Cox on the Shaky Foundation of Substack as a Business”">I linked</a> to <a href="https://newsletter.anamariecox.com/archive/substack-did-not-see-that-coming/" title="Ana Marie Cox: “Substack Did Not See That Coming”">Ana Marie Cox’s scathing analysis</a> of Substack’s financials. She published that on June 23, and wrote about Substack’s $100 million funding round, with a $1 billion valuation, in the future tense. Substack indeed closed that round in mid July, raising $100 million, with a valuation of $1.1 billion. After which their triumvirate of cofounders sat for an apparently brief “interview” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/business/substack-fundraising-social-network.html">with Benjamin Mullin and Jessica Testa of The New York Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Substack’s business model is simple: Users subscribe to follow
creators on the platform, and the company takes a 10 percent cut
of the revenue when those creators charge for a newsletter
subscription or access to a podcast. That approach initially made
Substack a writer’s haven, resulting in more than five million
paid subscriptions and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/business/media/substack-politics-newsletters.html">stable of publishers</a>, including
the short story master George Saunders, the historian Heather Cox
Richardson and an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/business/media/tv-news-anchors-substack.html">exodus of journalists</a> from traditional
newsrooms.</p>

<p>But the latest investors are betting on an emerging product that
could amplify its business. Substack’s app, introduced in 2022,
allows users to chat with their favorite creators, watch <a href="https://digiday.com/media/how-substack-creators-are-pooling-audiences-with-live-video-co-hosting/">live
video</a> conversations and write and share posts on their
own feeds through Notes, a feature similar to X or Bluesky.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If their business model were actually as simple as described, they’d already be profitable and wouldn’t have needed to raise another $100 million. They’ve already got a lot of subscribers. They’ve already got a stable of high-profile writers. They already keep 10 percent of what subscribers pay. And pointing to Twitter/X as the future model doesn’t exactly say “<em>Well that’s the path to enormous profits.</em>”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sharp increase in Substack’s valuation — nearly 70 percent
higher than its 2021 valuation of $650 million — is a validation
of that strategy from Substack’s investors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, this could be like when a guy who just lost every dollar in his pocket playing blackjack withdraws a few more grand from the ATM in the casino. That doesn’t “validate the strategy”. What would validate Substack’s strategy is showing proof of actual profits and profitable growth. And if they had actual profits and profitable growth they wouldn’t have needed to raise another $100 million.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The network is growing,” Mr. McKenzie said. “We’re in this new
phase where people can come to Substack and not just publish, but
also find new audiences and find new opportunity.” The company
today is more interested in taking on YouTube than MailChimp.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, to me, is the nut <a href="https://library.fiveable.me/key-terms/introduction-journalism/graf">graf</a> of the whole NYT piece. Substack since its debut has presented itself as a platform <em>for writers</em> to build publications <em>for readers</em>. That’s how everyone I know who would endorse Substack would describe it. Hamish McKenzie, the cofounder quoted here, proudly claims <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/chief-writing-officer">the job title “Chief Writing Officer”</a>. Does a company “more interested in taking on YouTube than MailChimp [<em>sic</em>]” sound like a company focused on writers as talent and readers as users to you? (And it’s a little thing, but Mailchimp doesn’t style their name camel-case. You’ll be unsurprised to be reminded that <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2017/by-dismantling-its-copy-desk-the-new-york-times-is-making-a-mistake-thats-been-made-before/">The New York Times dismantled its previously crackerjack copy desk</a> in 2017.)</p>

<p>Now let’s do some rough back-of-the-envelope math. The New York Times Company has a market cap of $8.5 billion. Just gut-feeling-wise, I do not think Substack is worth one-eighth of the Times, nor do I think they’re on a path to get there. The Times has around 11 million digital subscribers who pay between $5–35/month (depending on their subscription tier), and a strong advertising business. Individual Substack publications tend to charge around $5–7/month, and Substack only gets 10 percent of that. So Substack only pockets like 50–70 <em>cents</em> per month from subscribers, per publication. (Substack’s 10 percent commission, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/the_substack_branding_and_faux_prestige_trap">again</a>, is pretty high <a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/micro/entry/202504111009">compared to competing platforms</a>.) Substack currently has no advertising business at all, and many of their writers publish with them specifically because Substack, as we know it, has no ads.</p>

<p>I firmly believe one could build a very nice business taking 10 percent of subscription revenue for a blogging/newsletter platform, if you could get as nice a roster of popular writers to build on the platform as Substack has. I do not think that’s a $1 billion business, though. And if it were, they should, at this point, be able to get there on their own, without additional funding. They should have achieved profitability lift-off long ago.</p>

<p>But what do I know, other than running a profitable independent website for the last 20 or so years?</p>

	<summary type="text">Only with Substack does anyone perceive creator branding as being subservient to the platform — something that ought to be seen merely as an interchangeable CMS.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Among the handful of oft-discussed problems with Substack:</p>

<ul>
<li>Their 90/10 subscription revenue split isn’t usurious, but it’s <a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/micro/entry/202504111009">high compared to competing platforms</a> — especially once you reach an even mid-tier level of popularity.</li>
<li>The only way this independent publishing game works, by any credible definition of “the long run”, is to build your own audience. Substack has indies convinced that they build an audience for you through some sort of secret-sauce network effects, but I’ve seen no evidence that’s true. Writers with established reputations and readerships joining Substack are helping build Substack’s brand, not their own.</li>
<li>The whole, you know, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/02/substack-nazi-notification">Nazi thing</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Less commented upon but just as bad is the branding trap. <em>Substack</em> is a damn good name. It looks good, it sounds good. It’s short and crisp and unique. But now they’ve gotten people to call publications on Substack not “blogs” or “newsletters” but “substacks”. <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2024/11/19/dont_call_it_a_substack/">Don’t call them that</a>. And <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack">as I griped back in December</a>, even the way almost all Substack publications <em>look</em> is deliberately, if subtly, <em>Substack</em>-branded, not per-publication or per-writer branded.</p>

<p>Consider Paul Krugman. Krugman was an op-ed columnist for The New York Times from 2000–2024. But last year the Times wanted to cut him back from writing two columns a week plus his Times-hosted blog/newsletter to writing just one column per week and killing the blog. In <a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/paul-krugman-leaving-new-york-times-heavy-hand-editing-less-frequent-columns-newsletter.php">an interview with Columbia Journalism Review</a> early this year, Krugman also revealed that after over two decades, he’d started butting heads with his editors over style, tone, and even subject matter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’ve always been very, very lightly edited on the column,” he
said. “And that stopped being the case. The editing became
extremely intrusive. It was very much toning down of my voice,
toning down of the feel, and a lot of pressure for what I
considered false equivalence.” And, increasingly, attempts “to
dictate the subject.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Krugman rightfully and righteously told the Times, politely, to fuck off and struck out on his own. Reading Krugman this year, on his own site, has been like rediscovering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Coke">cane sugar Coca-Cola</a> after drinking the cheaper-to-produce corn syrup variant for a few years. This is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG9ip5ZOO9s">The Real Thing</a> — the unadulterated tart-tongued and sharp-elbowed Krugman I remember devouring during both the Bush and Obama administrations. The only hitch: Krugman hung out his independent shingle at Substack — which makes it a shingle under a shingle.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that for a certain class of writers and media commentators who, heretofore, have spent their careers at big-name publications — newspapers and magazines dating back to the print era, TV networks from the cable-is-king era — they actually find comfort writing under the auspices of Substack. See also: Terry Moran, who <a href="https://terrymoran.substack.com/">bounced to Substack</a> after ABC News declined to renew his contract — despite 28 years at the network, including <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/04/trump-declaration">this recent classic</a> — because of a tweet decrying Donald Trump and White House ghoul Stephen Miller. I suspect Moran, and perhaps even Krugman, perceive Substack as conveying a sort of badge of legitimacy. Self-published books, for example, used to be the refuge of kooks and no-talent hacks. I think some who spent their careers working at prestige outlets — especially those like Krugman and Moran, who are a bit older (than me) — feel a bit naked without one. But there’s no real prestige at Substack and never will be. I, for one, am fine with Substack’s liberal philosophy of letting anyone write there, but that means, well, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/02/substack-nazi-notification">anyone</a> can write there.</p>

<p>Here’s a recent example of the Substack branding trap that irks me — grating like fingernails on a chalkboard — and which I think proves my point. <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5464923">Krugman last month was interviewed by Steve Inskeep at NPR</a>, regarding Trump’s “grotesquely illegal” tariffs levied on Brazil. Introducing Krugman, Inskeep describes Krugman’s current work thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The people watching the tariff debate include Paul Krugman. He is
a writer and economist, formerly for The New York Times, now
writing independently on Substack, which is where I often find
him. And since he’s in the United States, I pay no tariff. Mr.
Krugman, welcome to the program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, so good. That’s a fair description. But, concluding the five-minute interview, Inskeep goes with this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paul Krugman writes for Substack, formerly with The New York
Times. Thanks so much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paul Krugman does not “write for Substack”. No one would say that <a href="https://sixcolors.com/">Jason Snell</a> “writes for WordPress”, or that <a href="https://kottke.org/">Jason Kottke</a> or yours truly “writes for Movable Type”. No one says <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/">Molly White</a>, <a href="https://www.platformer.news/">Casey Newton</a>, or <a href="https://www.cupofcoffeenews.com/">Craig Calcaterra</a> “writes for Ghost”, or that <a href="https://www.status.news/">Oliver Darcy</a> “writes for Beehiiv”. Only with Substack does anyone perceive creator branding as being subservient to the platform — something that ought to be seen merely as an interchangeable CMS — like that.</p>

<p>That is not by happenstance. It’s a trap and it is by design. It’s exactly what Substack wants, and exactly what independent writers and content producers should not.</p>

<p>Ana Marie Cox, <a href="https://www.anamariecox.com/about-me">who knows a thing or two</a> about indie publishing and journalism, on her AMC All the Time blog about a month ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My take is more dire, because I’m not sure about “savvy and
stamina” as the distinguishing characteristics of those who might
be able to migrate elsewhere. I think plenty of smart folks might
find themselves stuck.</p>

<p>Substack is rickety. It’s as unstable as a SpaceX launch, as
<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/dems-taunt-stephen-miller-over-191520373.html">overpromised</a> as a Stephen Miller marriage.</p>

<p>Substack does not have a clear future as a newsletter business,
I’m not the first to notice that. But it doesn’t have to fail
outright to be a disaster. It just has to keep trying to become a
life-sized map of the internet: maximum content, maximum churn.
The center cannot hold — especially not for newsletters, a format
that depends on intimacy and long-standing trust.</p>

<p>The Substack bust will not just take out a few hot-take merchants
and media dilettantes. It’s going to take down a lot of working
journalists who’ve built modest, sustainable incomes as well as
the fragile public sphere we’ve been piecing together in the ashes
of Twitter and the twilight of traditional journalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.usermag.co/p/substack-sent-a-push-alert-promoting-nazi-white-supremacist-blog">Taylor Lorenz’s scoop</a> today on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/02/substack-nazi-notification">Substack’s Nazi notification oopsie</a> reminded me that I’ve been meaning to link to this post from Cox casting a serious stink eye at Substack’s business. As she says up front, “Let’s set Substack’s ‘Nazi problem’ aside for a moment. What if the bigger issue is being stranded on a collapsing platform ... with a bunch of Nazis?”</p>

<p>Substack pitches itself to would-be independent writers as a thriving platform that’s fundamentally about independent blog publishing and email newsletter distribution. That could be a great business. But it would be a relatively small business compared to Substack’s fund raising (over $100 million so far, and currently <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/scoop-substack-in-talks-to-raise?utm_source=anamariecox&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=substack-did-not-see-that-coming">looking to raise more</a>) and the implied valuation that fund raising implies (at one point, they were pitching investors that they were worth $1 billion, which is about as realistic as El Gringo Loco Anaranjado’s promises that Mexico will pay for a US border wall).</p>

<p><a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> is a platform and business that’s actually built for independent writers. So is <a href="https://buttondown.com/">Buttondown</a> (which Cox uses for her site). <a href="https://www.beehiiv.com/">Beehiiv</a> too. There’s a whole cottage industry of creator-oriented blog-cum-newsletter platforms. Substack, on the other hand, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack">is a trap</a>. It breaks my heart to see great writers as disparate as <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/">Paul Krugman</a> and <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/michaelchabon/p/tragic-magic">Michael Chabon</a> set up their ostensibly independent presences on Substack. Writers check in, but — if Substack gets their way — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKhGHxO-woc">they won’t check out</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the numbers Cox lays out, Substack’s future looks even worse than I thought. Before they go under, though, their investors will put the screws to them, and Substack will take its heel turn.</p>

<p>Ashley Belanger, writing for Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After Substack shocked an unknown number of users by sending a
push notification on Monday to check out a Nazi blog featuring a
swastika icon, the company quickly apologized for the “error,”
<a href="https://www.usermag.co/p/substack-sent-a-push-alert-promoting-nazi-white-supremacist-blog">tech columnist Taylor Lorenz reported</a>. [...]</p>

<p>Substack has long faced backlash for allowing users to share their
“extreme views” on the platform, previously claiming that
“censorship (including through demonetizing publications)” doesn’t
make “the problem go away — in fact, it makes it worse,” Lorenz
noted. But critics who have slammed Substack’s rationale revived
their concerns this week, with some accusing Substack of promoting
extreme content through features like their push alerts and
“rising” lists, which flag popular newsletters and currently also
include Nazi blogs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/substack-sends-push-alert-for-nazi-newsletter-2000636663">Gizmodo reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The publication in question, NatSocToday, <a href="https://substack.com/@natsoctoday1">describes itself</a>
as a “National Socialist weekly newsletter featuring opinions and
news important to the National Socialist and White Nationalist
Community.” The newsletter’s image header is a Nazi flag, and its
latest post, as of Wednesday, was <a href="https://substack.com/@natsoctoday1/p-169055191">an article</a> that includes
the sentence: “We demand the return of all territory currently
occupied by jews and non-Whites in historically White homelands.”
It does not appear to be a particularly popular blog, and
currently has fewer than a thousand subscribers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A mantra  of “<em>we host all views, but don’t promote or endorse all views</em>” doesn’t hold much water when you promote a blog whose logo is a straight-up Nazi swastika.</p>

<p>Chance Miller, 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/21/apple-questions-validity-of-doj-antitrust-lawsuit-in-bid-to-dismiss-case/">voiced</a> its <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/02/tim-cook-doj-antitrust-apple-misguided/">opposition</a> to the
<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/21/doj-lawsuit-is-an-attempt-to-turn-the-iphone-into-android-apple-alleges/">case</a> many <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/21/apple-says-doj-lawsuit-threatens-who-we-are-as-it-vows-to-vigorously-defend-against-it/">times</a> over the last year. Now, it has
officially filed its answer to the DOJ’s antitrust complaint,
pushing back forcefully against the allegations.</p>

<p>As a refresher, the DOJ’s antitrust lawsuit focuses on five major
aspects of the iPhone experience: super apps, cloud streaming
games, third-party messaging apps, third-party smartwatches, and
third-party digital wallets. In today’s filing, Apple says the DOJ
“fundamentally misunderstands” those five things.</p>

<p>Apple outlines:</p>

<ul>
<li>DOJ says Apple stifles the success of “super apps,” despite the
fact that Apple’s rules allow and support such apps, and indeed
a multitude of “super apps” exist on the App Store today.</li>
<li>DOJ says Apple blocks cloud streaming games, even though Apple
allows streaming games both over the web and in the App Store
where they can stream games directly to users.</li>
<li>DOJ says Apple degrades third-party messaging apps, even though
they are widely available and enormously popular on iPhone
already.</li>
<li>DOJ says Apple limits the functionality of third-party
smartwatches, even though they can effectively pair with iPhone,
share data to and from the iPhone via a companion app, and take
advantage of certain functionalities Apple has developed, which
are expanding over time.</li>
<li>DOJ says Apple withholds access to iPhone hardware necessary for
third-party digital wallets to use tap-to-pay technology;
however, Apple developed and provides a mechanism that protects
user security.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>One part of Apple’s defense that seems mostly proven already is that this industry moves fast and the competitive landscape is always changing. I’d say three of the DOJ’s five main arguments are already stale: Apple has since opened up cloud gaming; third-party messaging apps can now be set as default; and tap-to-pay has been opened up. And I think the other two points, on “super apps” and third-party connected devices like watches, are nonsense. Especially <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/10/everything">the “super apps” thing</a>.</p>

<p>Miller, of course, embeds Apple’s full response at the bottom of his post. The argument is worth a read — it’s very cogently and plainly written.</p>

	<summary type="text">Tea remains a chart-topping app in the App Store, but isn’t listed at all in Play Store top lists.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tea remains <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/charts/iphone/top-free-apps/36">#3 overall in the US iPhone App Store</a>. Here’s a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/07/us-iphone-app-store-top-10-2025-07-30.png">screenshot of the top free iPhone apps today</a>, and a list of the current top 10, using the full names the apps choose to display:</p>

<ol>
<li>ChatGPT</li>
<li>Wingstop</li>
<li>Tea Dating Advice</li>
<li>Threads</li>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Google Maps</li>
<li>WhatsApp Messenger</li>
<li>ParentSquare</li>
<li>CapCut - Video Editor</li>
<li>TikTok - Videos, Shop &amp; LIVE</li>
</ol>

<p>I might be forgetting or unaware of previous similar situations, but I can’t recall anything like this before, where an app riddled with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/28/tea-breach-worsens">outrageous security/privacy vulnerabilities</a> remains virally popular. A Hacker News thread from earlier today <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44732995">debates why the app is even still available on the App Store</a>.</p>

<p>So is it Apple’s place to yank the app? It feels wrong to me that Apple should completely remove Tea from the App Store, but it’s also true that one of Apple’s fundamental pitches for the App Store — and the App Store’s exclusivity for app distribution in most of the world — is that iOS users can trust any and all apps in the App Store because they’re vetted by Apple. But here’s Tea, sitting at #3, providing a service that many women want, and the entire thing is shockingly untrustworthy. (I fully expect more vulnerabilities to be found and exploited.)</p>

<p>Tea, unsurprisingly, has almost nothing on <a href="https://www.teaforwomen.com/">their website</a> about the security violations their users have suffered, nor any mention in their App Store listing. Their only public acknowledgement of the fiasco is a series of three Instagram posts on July <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theteapartygirls/p/DMjRl4CPE0z/">26</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theteapartygirls/p/DMl3E0TvoML/">27</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theteapartygirls/p/DMrGSlrJA-e/">29</a> (the most recent of which acknowledges that they’ve completely disabled the DM feature “temporarily”), and <a href="https://www.teaforwomen.com/cyberincident">this FAQ</a> on their website, that, as far as I can tell, is only discoverable through the “links in bio” on their Instagram profile. Their FAQ only addresses the initial discovery from last week, not <a href="https://www.404media.co/a-second-tea-breach-reveals-users-dms-about-abortions-and-cheating/">the more significant one that 404 Media publicized Monday</a> that included the exposure of DMs.</p>

<p>Also fascinating to me is that Tea, though available on both iOS <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tea.tea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">and Android</a>, is seemingly not popular at all on Android. It’s not even listed <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps?hl=en_US">in the Play Store’s top free apps</a>. (The Play Store website lists only the top 45, but I scrolled through the entire top 200 on my Pixel.) The current Play Store top 10:</p>

<ol>
<li>ChatGPT</li>
<li>TikTok - Videos, Shop &amp; LIVE</li>
<li>Threads</li>
<li>WhatsApp Messenger</li>
<li>Temu: Shop Like a Billionaire</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>TikTok Lite - Faster TikTok</li>
<li>DramaBox - Stream Drama Shorts</li>
<li>Cash App</li>
<li>Snapchat</li>
</ol>

<p>More tellingly, Tea doesn’t even crack the Play Store top 200 list for the “Dating” category. (On iOS, it’s in the “Lifestyle” category, but on the Play Store it’s in the “Dating” and “Casual” categories. Perhaps Apple requires apps in the “Dating” category to be full-fledged dating app services, not dating-app-adjacent like Tea.)</p>

<p>I’m not sure what explains the disparity in Tea’s popularity by platform. One assumption is that dating is more of a young person’s game, and young people skew slightly more toward iPhone than the US population overall. But from what I can tell, that skew is only about 10 percent. Also, surveys suggest <a href="https://www.sci-tech-today.com/stats/iphone-vs-android-user-statistics/">women are more likely to be iPhone users</a>. But I can’t believe that age or gender demographics alone explain why Tea is #3 in the App Store but doesn’t even crack the top 200 on Android.</p>

<p>I strongly suspect that, although Google hasn’t removed Tea from the Play Store, they’ve delisted it from discovery other than by searching for it by name or following a direct link to its listing. That both jibes with what I’m seeing on the Play Store top lists, and strikes me as a thoughtful balance between the responsibilities of an app store provider. As egregious as Tea’s security exploits have been, removing the app entirely doesn’t seem called for. But delisting it from popularity lists seems like a measured way to discourage new users from trying it unless they’re specifically looking for it. If this is what Google is doing, Apple should follow their lead. (I’ve put in a question to Google’s PR inquiring about this; if/when I get an answer, I’ll update this article.)</p>

<p>Sarah Perez, TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>YouTube on Tuesday announced it’s beginning to roll out
age-estimation technology in the U.S. to identify teen users in
order to provide a more age-appropriate experience. The company
says it will use a variety of signals to determine the users’
possible age, regardless of what the user entered as their
birthday when they signed up for an account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well-intentioned though I think this is, it still feels more than a little dystopian.</p>

<p>Reuters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sony released the first game in the <em>Horizon</em> series, <em>Horizon:
Zero Dawn</em>, on its PlayStation 4 in 2017. The games follow a
red-headed woman named Aloy as she navigates a post-apocalyptic
world populated by human tribes and robotic animals.</p>

<p>Sony said in its complaint that it declined an offer from Tencent
to collaborate on a new <em>Horizon</em> game last year. Tencent later
announced <em>Light of Motiram</em>, which Sony said features identical
gameplay, story themes and artistic elements to <em>Horizon</em> as well
as many other similarities.</p>

<p>Sony said that video game journalists have characterized <em>Light of
Motiram</em> as a “knock-off” of <em>Horizon</em>, including one who called
the game <em>Horizon Zero Originality</em>.</p>

<p>Sean Lyndersay, general manager of Edge at Microsoft:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For decades, the way we’ve used browsers has remained linear: open
a tab (or 20), search for something, read a page, repeat. It’s a
model that’s worked well, but it hasn’t fundamentally changed.
Until now. As AI begins to reshape nearly every facet of digital
life, we’re witnessing a turning point in how we interact with the
web. Now, it’s worth asking: is your browser working for you as
much as it should?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Color me skeptical about the idea that my web browser should be “working for me”, rather than serving as a tool for me to work with. The AI hype cycle is pointing to a future where automated agentic web browsers surf automated AI-generated websites. Robots consuming robot-generated content — an infinite loop of AI onanism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is why today we’re excited to launch Copilot Mode, a new
experimental mode in Microsoft Edge, and our next step towards
building a more powerful way to pilot the web.</p>

<p>With Copilot Mode on, you enable innovative AI features in Edge
that enhance your browser. It doesn’t just wait idly for you to
click but anticipates what you might want to do next. It doesn’t
just give you endless tabs to sift through but works with you as a
collaborator that makes sense of it all. It keeps you browsing,
cuts through clutter and removes friction to unlock your flow — all built to the highest Microsoft standards of security, privacy
and performance trusted by billions of people and businesses
worldwide — with you as the user always in control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft is famously known for presenting interfaces that “cut through clutter” and “remove friction”. I’m sure this will be great.</p>

<p>I am reminded of the decade-ago <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/29/hbo-netflix">Netflix strategy espoused by Ted Sarandos</a>: “The goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.” I think something similar is behind Microsoft trying to make Copilot front-and-center in Edge, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/29/chrome-ai-shopping">Google’s concurrent move to junk up Chrome</a> with AI-generated suggestions. Their goal is to make their web browsers chatbots faster than OpenAI can make ChatGPT a web browser.</p>

<p>HBO is still around. It even just <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/14/hbo-max-again">got its name back</a>. But Netflix won that race.</p>

<p>Sarah Perez, writing for TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google on Monday announced an update to its Chrome web browser
that will introduce AI-generated store reviews to U.S. shoppers
with the aim of helping to determine the best places to make a
purchase. The feature, which will be available by clicking an icon
just to the left of the web address in the browser, will display a
pop-up that informs consumers about the store’s reputation for
things like product quality, shopping, pricing, customer service,
and returns.</p>

<p>The feature, which is currently available only in English, will
generate the summaries based on reviews from partners, including
Bazaarvoice, Bizrate Insights, Reputation.com, Reseller Ratings,
ScamAdviser, Trustpilot, TurnTo, Yotpo, Verified Reviews, <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/190657?hl=en#Supported_Review_Partners">and
others</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have never heard of a single one of these “partners”. It’s bad enough that so many web pages themselves are increasingly covered with distracting junk, much of it AI-generated slop. But now browsers themselves will be adding their own layers of distracting cruft atop the websites. The entire premise of Chrome — the reason for its name — is that it was originally designed to simplify the UI of the browser app itself, the “chrome”, at a time when Internet Explorer and even Firefox were increasingly cluttered and confusing. I feel like this is a sign that Chrome is completely losing its way — AI-generated slop from the browser layered atop AI-generated slop in the underlying web pages.</p>

<p>Dare Obasanjo, on Bluesky, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carnage4life.bsky.social/post/3lv2vvzlbd22o">takes this news credulously</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google Chrome is now going to provide AI generated summaries of
online stores covering topics like customer service, product
quality, shipping, pricing and return policy.</p>

<p>This is on the heels of Microsoft Edge announcing Copilot mode
earlier today. Apple’s Safari is being left behind in the AI wars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would argue that Safari is looking ever more like a proverbial glass of ice water in hell. These Chrome AI overviews (Chrome is also, for example, going to start presenting its own <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-business-profiles-menu-ai-summaries-39838.html">AI-generated menu summaries for restaurants</a>) don’t seem like user-centric features to me. They seem like features designed to turn the dial up on Google’s slice of commissions from web transactions.</p>

<p>Emanuel Maiberg and Joseph Cox, reporting <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/26/4chan-tea-breach">again</a> for 404 Media:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite Tea’s initial statement that “the incident involved a
legacy data storage system containing information from over two
years ago,” the second issue impacting a separate database is much
more recent, affecting messages up until last week, according to
the researcher’s findings that 404 Media verified. The researcher
said they also found the ability to send a push notification to
all of Tea’s users.</p>

<p>It’s hard to overstate how sensitive this data is and how it could
put Tea’s users at risk if it fell into the wrong hands. When
signing up, Tea encourages users to choose an anonymous
screenname, but it was trivial for 404 Media to find the real
world identities of some users given the nature of their messages,
which Tea has led them to believe were private. Users could be
easily found via their social media handles, phone numbers, and
real names that they shared in these chats. These conversations
also frequently make damning accusations against people who are
also named in the private messages and in some cases are easy to
identify. [...]</p>

<p>Some of the private messages viewed by 404 Media include:</p>

<ul>
<li>One user tells another they just discovered their husband on the
app being discussed. “I am his wife,” many of the messages say.</li>
<li>Another appears to show a woman contacting others about a man
she is engaged to.</li>
<li>Multiple messages which appear to show women discussing their
abortions.</li>
<li>Chat logs between women discovering they are dating the same
man, exchanging information such as what car he drives for
verification.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>When <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/26/4chan-tea-breach">I linked to 404 Media’s coverage</a> of the initial breach at Tea the other day, I wrote, “I’m not accusing Tea in particular of being vibe-coded”. Well, I still don’t know if Tea’s service architecture was vibe-coded, but it’s now clear that whoever made it was shamefully incompetent. They shouldn’t have made <em>any</em> sort of services backend, let alone one like Tea’s that’s intended to carry incredibly sensitive personal information and messages.</p>

<p>This is an outright privacy — and quite possibly, personal security — disaster. With the abortion discussions and the current bifurcation of women’s rights here in the US, it could be a legal disaster, too. 4chan clowns have taken the images and data and <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/whats-going-on-with-the-tea-app-data-leak-the-tea-app-map-and-memes-about-ranking-foids-on-teaspill-explained">created</a> maps of Tea users’ addresses, and a Mark-Zuckerberg-“Facemash”-style site for ranking users’ appearance.</p>

<p>For women who’ve already signed up and started using Tea, I doubt there’s anything that can be done to remove them from exposure. Even if Tea offers a “delete your account” feature, I wouldn’t trust that it actually deletes <em>anything</em> from their database, let alone everything. And the cat’s already out of the bag for any bad actors who figured out this second exploit before Tea was alerted.</p>

<p>Yet another data point for the argument that any “private messaging” feature that doesn’t use E2EE isn’t actually private at all.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/senate/nrsc-apple-ios-fundraising/">this paywalled report at Punchbowl News</a>, as quoted by Taegan Goddard at Political Wire:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Senate GOP campaign arm <a href="https://punchbowl.news/nrsc-letter/">is warning</a> that Apple’s new
iOS update could cost them $25 million in fundraising revenue, as
well as priceless GOTV opportunities,” <a href="https://punchbowl.news/archive/72825-midday-2/">Punchbowl News</a>
reports.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/07/nrsc-letter-ios-26.jpeg">Here’s a copy of the original memo from the NRSC</a> (National Republican Senatorial Committee). What they’re freaking out about is the new iOS 26 Messages feature (which will be available in Messages on iPadOS and MacOS 26 too — but because these messages are sent as SMS and because the iPhone is so many people’s primary or sole messaging device, it’s the platform they’re focusing on) <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/03/ios-26s-messages-app-has-a-solution-coming-for-unwanted-texts/">that will automatically sort messages from unknown senders</a> into a new “Unknown Sender” inbox.</p>

<p>Quoting from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/07/nrsc-letter-ios-26.jpeg">the NRSC letter</a> (emphasis in original):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s iOS 26 update introduces aggressive message filtering.
Political texts — even from verified and compliant senders-will
be treated as spam by default, silently sent to an “Unknown” inbox
with no alerts or notifications. That change has profound
implications for our ability to fundraise, mobilize voters, and
run digital campaigns.</p>

<p><em>It’s important to understand: Apple isn’t just targeting cold
outreach or spammy actors.</em> Every political message — shortcode,
long code, doesn’t matter-gets pushed into the dark. The only
workaround-getting a voter to reply — is increasingly rare and
entirely at the mercy of Apple’s unclear rules. How will a voter
reply if they never get the message?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s “rules” for this new feature aren’t unclear at all. If a sender is not in your saved contacts and you’ve never sent or responded to a text message from them, they’re considered “unknown”. That’s it. The feature isn’t even really new — you’ve been able to <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/block-filter-and-report-messages-iph203ab0be4/ios">filter messages like this in Messages for years now</a>, but what iOS 26 changes is that it now <s>will be on by default and</s> has a new more prominent — better, IMO — interface for switching between filter views. <strong>Update:</strong> I was wrong that this filtering will be on by default in iOS 26 — I was fooled because I had previously enabled “Filter Unknown Senders” in Settings → Apps → Messages → Unknown &amp; Spam (which you need to scroll down quite a bit to get to). I do think, though, that many more iOS users will be using this feature starting with iOS 26 — it’s both better designed and less hidden.</p>

<p>Back to the NRSC letter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s the shift in practice. Today, a voter with an iPhone gets
our message just like a normal text. In iOS 26, unless that
person has already replied, our message is silently sent to the
“Unknown” inbox. No ping, no badge, just buried in an inbox few
people ever check.</p>

<p>We’ve spent years complying with rigorous standards — providing full
documentation, opt-in proof, and message samples via Campaign
Verify and The Campaign Registry — yet Apple ignores that. <em>Carriers
respect it. Apple doesn’t.</em></p>

<p>Estimated prospecting losses: <em>NRSC alone could see a $25M+
revenue hit</em>. Since 70% of small-dollar donations come via text,
and iPhones make up 60% of US mobile devices, <em>the macro effect
could be over $500M in lost GOP revenue</em>. [...]</p>

<p>Unfortunately, K St and trade groups are asleep at the wheel.
Apple isn’t engaging. But we have only a few weeks left before the
public release. <em>If we’re going to push back, it has to be now. We

<p>“Unknown Senders” isn’t spam. It’s for ... unknown senders. Which these political texts are. I don’t know anyone who enjoys getting these texts in their primary timeline of messages. What the NRSC is asserting here is that they have a right to put political solicitations in your primary Messages view, and to have them appear as notifications, which is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Also, there’s no reason to believe that Republican candidates and groups will be more affected by this than Democratic ones. There’s no filtering by message content. It’s just a change to stop sending notifications for texts from unknown senders, and to put those messages in a separate timeline by default. People <em>will</em> check the Unknown Senders timeline occasionally too — all sorts of text messages from bots will go there, including some you want or need.</p>

<p>Adam Aaronson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://iba-world.com/">International Bartenders Association</a>, or IBA,
maintains a list of official cocktails, ones they deem to be
“the most requested recipes” at bars all around the world. It’s
the closest thing the bartending industry has to a canonical
list of cocktails, akin to the American Kennel Club’s registry
of <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/">dog breeds</a> or a jazz musician’s <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-real-book/">Real Book</a> of
standards. [...]</p>

<p>As of 2025, there are 102 IBA official cocktails, and as of July
12, 2025, <a href="https://aaronson.org/cocktails/">I’ve had every one of them</a>.</p>

<p>The journey has taken me to some interesting places, and now that
it’s done, I have a little story to tell for each cocktail. I’m
not gonna tell you all 102 stories, but I do want to debrief the
experience. Drinking all 102 cocktails turned out to be
unexpectedly tricky, and for reasons you’ll soon understand, I
might be one of the first people in the world to do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fun story, copiously documented with details, locations, photos, and sidenotes. Truly a blogger’s blog post.</p>

<p>Dominic Preston, writing at The Verge, regarding Android fans’ bristling at ICEBlock developer Joshua Aaron’s claims that an Android (or web) version of ICEBlock couldn’t provide the same level of privacy as the iOS version:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aaron told The Verge ICEBlock is built around a single database in
iCloud. When a user taps on the map to report ICE sightings, the
location data is added to that database, and users within five
miles are automatically sent a push notification alerting them.
Push notifications require developers to have some way of
designating which devices receive them, and while Aaron declined
to say precisely how the notifications function, he said alerts
are sent through Apple’s system, not ICEBlock’s, letting him avoid
keeping his own database of users or their devices. “We utilized
iCloud in kind of a creative way,” Aaron said. [...]</p>

<p>But you might have spotted the problem: ICEBlock isn’t collecting
device data on iOS, but only because similar data is stored with
Apple instead.</p>

<p>Apple maintains a database of which devices and accounts have
installed a given app, and Carlos Anso from GrapheneOS told me
that it likely also tracks device registrations for push
notifications. For either ICEBlock’s iOS app or a hypothetical
Android app, law enforcement could demand information directly
from the company, cutting ICEBlock out of the loop. Aaron told me
that he has “no idea what Apple would store,” and it “has nothing
to do with ICEBlock.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/07/security-vulnerabilities-in-iceblock.html">Bruce Schneier linked to this story</a> saying “the ICEBlock tool has vulnerabilities”, but I don’t think that’s a fair description. As far as we know, ICEBlock is as private as possible while still enabling push notifications, and a hypothetical Android version couldn’t be as private. But that privacy does depend on trust in Apple.</p>

<p><strong>Also worth a note:</strong> Aaron’s wife, Carolyn Feinstein, was an auditor at the Department of Justice but <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/iceblock-app-founder-wife-fired-doj-carolyn-feinstein-2102214">was fired last month because of her husband’s app</a>.</p>

<p>Back in 2021 a young engineering student named Ken Pillonel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAekbJf4Gsw">modified his own iPhone X</a> to replace the Lightning port with USB-C, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/11/iphone-gets-usb-c-thanks-to-creative-robotics-engineer">which became a small viral sensation</a>. He’s back at it, with a far more ambitious project: iPhone cases with USB-C  ports for the last five or so years of models with Lightning ports. He’s produced three batches of cases so far, but is <a href="https://obsoless.com/products/iph0n3-usb-c-protection-case">currently sold out</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you’re not interested in buying one of these cases, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUXQzVD1TdI">Pillonel’s video documenting how he brought the concept to fruition</a> is quite clever and fun.</p>

<p>Max A. Cherney and Stephen Nellis, reporting for Reuters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those customers for the company’s so-called 14A manufacturing
process are crucial to the success of the technology — so much so
that if it fails to secure a big one, it could shut down its
cutting-edge manufacturing business altogether, according to
Intel’s quarterly filing on Thursday.</p>

<p>The possibility that Intel could drop out of the cutting-edge
manufacturing business would be a historic shift for a company
that has described itself as a steward of Moore’s Law — an
observation by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore about the fast rate
of development of the chip industry that held true for decades.
Intel is the only U.S. chipmaker capable of making advanced
computing chips.</p>

<p>Intel has struggled for years due to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/inside-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-fumbled-revival-an-american-icon-2024-10-29/">management missteps</a>,
missing out on the AI race and losing market share to its longtime
rival AMD.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The beginning of the end for Intel was long before the AI race or the market share they’ve lost to AMD. It was missing out on mobile. From <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/paul-otellinis-intel-can-the-company-that-built-the-future-survive-it/275825/">a 2013 profile of then-CEO Paul Otellini</a>, by Alexis Madrigal for The Atlantic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But, oh, what could have been! Even Otellini betrayed a profound
sense of disappointment over a decision he made about a
then-unreleased product that became the iPhone. Shortly after
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkUpQZxLv4g">winning Apple’s Mac business</a>, he decided against doing what it
took to be the chip in Apple’s paradigm-shifting product.</p>

<p>“We ended up not winning it or passing on it, depending on how you
want to view it. And the world would have been a lot different if
we’d done it,” Otellini told me in a two-hour conversation during
his last month at Intel. “The thing you have to remember is that
this was before the iPhone was introduced and no one knew what the
iPhone would do... At the end of the day, there was a chip that
they were interested in that they wanted to pay a certain price
for and not a nickel more and that price was below our forecasted
cost. I couldn’t see it. It wasn’t one of these things you can
make up on volume. And in hindsight, the forecasted cost was wrong
and the volume was 100× what anyone thought.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was it, the beginning of the end. It’s not just that mobile computing, as defined by the iPhone, became the largest market, by far, for chips, but that the needs of mobile devices defined the future of leading edge chipmaking across all industries: performance-per-watt, not merely sheer performance. As mobile grew, so went the economies of scale, which resulted in Apple Silicon eventually beating x86 chips not just in performance-per-watt but also in single-core performance.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Emma Roth, The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google will officially deprecate links generated with its URL
shortening tool next month. On August 25th, 2025, all links in the
<code>https://goo.gl/*</code> format will no longer work and return a 404
error message.</p>

<p>Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/31/17184164/google-alphabet-url-shortening-service-closed">shut down its URL shortener in 2019</a>, citing “changes
we’ve seen in how people find content on the internet.” Links
created with the tool continued to work since then, but Google
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201734/google-url-link-shortening-service-shut-down-support">announced last year</a> that it would begin deprecating them as
traffic to the shortened URLs declined. “In fact more than 99% of
them had no activity in the last month,” Google said in its <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-url-shortener-links-will-no-longer-be-available/">July
2024 blog post</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The heyday for link shorteners was the era when Twitter (a) was still Twitter, (b) had a 140-character post limit, and (c) counted characters such that each character of a URL counted toward the 140-character limit. None of those things are true anymore. But, still. <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URLs don’t change</a>.</p>

<p>I’m sure it is true that 99 percent of goo.gl links had no activity in the past month. But I’m just as sure that it would cost next to nothing for Google to keep goo.gl up and running in perpetuity. I mean, 99 percent of <em>all</em> URLs probably had no activity in the last month. 99 percent of all books ever written weren’t read in the last month either, I bet — but that’s no excuse for libraries to throw them in the trash.</p>

<p>It’s fine that Google stopped allowing for the creating of new links a while back, but there’s no reason they should ever stop redirecting existing links. The whole reason anyone might have used goo.gl instead of something like <a href="https://bit.ly/">bit.ly</a> is misplaced trust in Google. I trust Google with almost nothing long-term. Mark my words, they’re going to do this with Gmail accounts eventually.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Google has come to its senses and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/03/google-reverses-course-on-googl">will keep these redirections working</a>.</p>

<p>Emanuel Maiberg and Joseph Cox, reporting for 404 Media:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Users from 4chan claim to have discovered an exposed database
hosted on Google’s mobile app development platform, Firebase,
belonging to the newly popular women’s dating safety app Tea.
Users say they are rifling through peoples’ personal data and
selfies uploaded to the app, and then posting that data online,
according to screenshots, 4chan posts, and code reviewed by 404
Media. In a statement to 404 Media, Tea confirmed the breach also
impacted some direct messages but said that the data is from two
years ago.</p>

<p>Tea, which claims to have more than 1.6 million users, reached the
top of the App Store charts this week and has tens of thousands of
reviews there. The app aims to provide a space for women to
exchange information about men in order to stay safe, and verifies
that new users are women by asking them to upload a selfie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tea-dating-advice/id6444453051">Tea</a> jumped to the top spot in the App Store (it’s still at #4 as I type this, trailing only ChatGPT, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video) and has been getting a lot of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tea-app-women-share-anonymous-dating-reviews-goes-viral-2025-7">coverage this week</a>. A wide open, publicly accessible database of users’ driver’s licenses and self portraits is, to say the least, pretty egregious.</p>

<p>I’m not accusing Tea in particular of being vibe-coded, but I do wonder if this sort of thing is going to become commonplace as more apps and services come online after being developed in slapdash AI-assisted manners.</p>

<p>The public betas are out for iOS/iPadOS/WatchOS/MacOS 26, and Dan Moren and Jason Snell cover them all at Six Colors. Here’s Moren on iOS 26:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s new design language, dubbed Liquid Glass, applies across
all their platforms, but unsurprisingly, it feels most at home on
the iPhone and iPad. That’s in part because of the touch
interface; the literal hands-on nature makes the feel responsive
and more like physical things that you’re interacting with. For
example, dragging the new magnifying loupe across the screen,
watching the way it magnifies and distorts text and images as it
passes over them — this interaction has always been unique to iOS
for practical reasons, but the way it feels here doesn’t have a
direct analogue on other platforms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For it now being late July, though, there remain a lot of <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/114909122813996684">glaring problems</a>. I hope to be proven wrong, but I think the legibility/usability problems are going to make the 26.0 versions of Apple’s OSes unpopular. Functionally, iOS and iPadOS 26 betas 4 are solid. MacOS 26 Tahoe really adds some great productivity features. But visually, not so much for any of these OSes (especially MacOS) — and that, to me, is a serious problem.</p>

<p>Anyway, public beta commentary:</p>

	<summary type="text">To maintain anonymity and store zero user data, there is and can be no web app version of ICEBlock. There is and can be no Android version. Only iOS supports the security and privacy features for ICEBlock to offer what it does, the way it does.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.iceblock.app/">ICEBlock</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ICEBlock is an innovative, completely anonymous crowdsourced
platform that allows users to report Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) activity with just two taps on their phone. In
recent years, ICE has faced criticism for alleged civil rights
abuses and failures to adhere to constitutional principles and due
process, making it crucial for communities to stay informed about
its operations.</p>

<p>Modeled after Waze but for ICE sightings, the app ensures user
privacy by storing no personal data, making it impossible to trace
reports back to individual users. Available exclusively for iOS
devices, ICEBlock empowers communities to stay informed about ICE
presence within a 5-mile radius while maintaining their anonymity
through real-time updates and automatic deletion of sightings
after four hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ICEBlock app is interesting in and of itself (and from my tire-kicking test drive, appears to be a well-crafted and designed app), as will be Apple’s response if (when?) the Trump administration takes offense to the app’s existence. Back in 2019, kowtowing to tacit demands from China, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/10/apple-pulls-hkmaps">Apple removed from the App Store an app called HKmap.live</a> which helped pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong know the location of police and protest activity. The app broke no Hong Kong laws, but <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/10/768841864/after-china-objects-apple-removes-app-used-by-hong-kong-protesters">scared the thin-skinned skittish lickspittles in the Chinese Communist Party</a>. (Remember too that in 2019, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/07/taiwan-flag-emoji">Apple removed the Taiwan flag emoji</a> (🇹🇼) from the iOS 13 keyboard for users in Hong Kong and Macau.)</p>

<p>One defense from Apple regarding HKmap.live, however, was that the iOS app was a thin wrapper around the website, which website remained fully functional and could be saved to an iPhone user’s home screen. Removing the app from the App Store thus did not prevent Hong Kongers from accessing it. (<a href="https://hkmap.live/">That website</a> today <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKmap.live">seems to be defunct</a>.)</p>

<p>ICEBlock is different. It is <em>only</em> available as a native iOS app. According to the developers, this is for technical reasons. From their web page explaining <a href="https://www.iceblock.app/android">why they <em>can’t</em> offer an Android version</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At ICEBlock, user privacy and security are paramount. Our
application is designed to provide as much anonymity as possible
without storing any user data or creating accounts. While we
understand the desire for an Android version of ICEBlock,
achieving this level of anonymity on Android is not feasible due
to the inherent requirements of push notification services.</p>

<p>To send push notifications on Android, it is necessary to use a
mechanism that requires storing device IDs. This means that we
would need to maintain a privately hosted database to store these
identifiers. Storing such data, even if it’s anonymized,
introduces significant privacy risks. [...]</p>

<p>In contrast, iOS offers us the flexibility to deliver push
notifications while adhering strictly to our design philosophy.
Apple’s ecosystem allows for push notifications to be sent without
requiring us to store any user-identifiable information. This
ensures that ICEBlock remains completely anonymous and secure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To deliver push notifications on Android, the developers claim they would need to maintain a database of device IDs, create a user account system to manage those device IDs, and all of that server-stored data would be susceptible to law enforcement subpoenas and pro-ICE red hat hackers. (What “brown shirts” were to the Nazis, we should make “red hats” to MAGA.)</p>

<p>To maintain anonymity and store zero user data, there is and can be no web app version of ICEBlock. There is and can be no Android version. Only iOS supports the security and privacy features for ICEBlock to offer what it does, the way it does. Here’s to hoping that Apple will proudly defend it if push comes to shove.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<h2>Why CBS’s Cancellation of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” Stinks to High Hell</h2>

<p>Even back in the now-comparatively-sane Trump 1.0 administration, it seemed palpably true to me that the best check against Trump’s authoritarian instincts wasn’t legal or Constitutional, but rather cultural. The culture of free speech, of being able to criticize — in no uncertain terms, with no held punches — anyone in authority is fundamental to the American mindset. It’s like the opening of David Foster Wallace’s “This Is Water” 2005 commencement address to Kenyon College:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Greetings parents and congratulations to Kenyon’s graduating class
of 2005. There are these two young fish swimming along and they
happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at
them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young
fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over
at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”</p>

<p>This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the
deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story thing
turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of
the genre, but if you’re worried that I plan to present myself
here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you
younger fish, please don’t be. I am not the wise old fish. The
point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important
realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk
about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a
banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches
of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death
importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely
morning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the way that fish take water for granted, Americans take <a href="https://xkcd.com/1357/">true freedom of speech</a> and freedom of the press for granted. It’s the culture we were born into, the air we breathe. And to my mind, the fiercest and most effective form of criticism — especially political — is mockery. Mark Twain, America’s first great (and perhaps still greatest) humorist, said, “Against the assault of laughter, nothing can stand.”</p>

<p>No one in Russian media mocks Vladimir Putin, lest they find themselves falling out one of <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-russians-fall-windows-putin-ukraine-war-1781790">Russia’s easily-fallen-out-of windows</a>. No one in Chinese media mocks Xi Jinping. Back in 2017 the CCP went as far as to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Winnie-the-Pooh_in_China">censor images of Winnie the Pooh</a>, because Xi resembles Pooh so clearly, and people naturally find that amusing. Trump, clearly, has authoritarian instincts and desires, but US media — print, web, podcasts, YouTube, social, and TV — has been replete with unrelenting mockery aimed at him. There’s no better example of that than late night talk shows: Colbert on CBS, Jimmy Kimmel on ABC, Seth Meyers on NBC, Jon Stewart and his fellow hosts on <em>The Daily Show</em> at Comedy Central, John Oliver and Bill Maher on HBO. Vociferous, unrelenting critics of Trump, all of them. (And it works both ways: Greg Gutfield’s <em>Gutfield!</em> is <a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/1202434/late-night-ratings-2025-gutfeld-kimmel-colbert-fallon/">a ratings success at 10:00pm for Fox News</a>.)</p>

<p>That’s been one of the canaries I’ve been monitoring in the Trump 2.0 drift-into-authoritarianism coal mine. So long as Trump is getting skewered by comedians on major TV channels nightly, in some sense, we’re doing OK.</p>

<p>But while our Constitution and cultural fabric protect our media from <em>government</em> interference, there’s no such protection from <em>ownership</em> interference. Trump can’t dictate what a newspaper prints — proven again, just last night, by The Wall Street Journal, which added significant fuel to the Epstein fire that’s rupturing MAGAland with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796?mod=hp_lead_pos7">a scoop on a dirty birthday letter Trump wrote to his friend Epstein in 2003</a>, despite Trump trying to quash the story by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/17/media/trump-rupert-murdoch-wsj-epstein-story-lawsuit-threat">directly calling Journal owner Rupert Murdoch</a>. Trump can’t dictate who hosts late-night TV shows or censor the jokes they tell, and we still seem far from a world where Jimmy Kimmel might mysteriously “fall” from a high window.</p>

<p>But the owners, they can do what they want. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/profiles_in_cowardice_bezos_lewis_washington_post">Jeff Bezos kiboshed The Washington Post’s already-written endorsement of Kamala Harris</a> — on the cusp of the election — and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/journalism_requires_owners_committed_to_the_cause">torched the paper’s previously sterling reputation</a> of independence and journalistic integrity. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/13/soon-shiong-la-times">Patrick Soon-Shiong has done similar</a> to the LA Times.</p>

<p>CBS is owned by Paramount, and Paramount is controlled by Shari Redstone. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_merger_of_Skydance_Media_and_Paramount_Global">Redstone has a deal to sell Paramount to Skydance</a>, a company controlled by David Ellison (son of Oracle gazillionaire Larry Ellison) for $8 billion, but the deal needs approval from the FCC, and the FCC answers to Trump. That’s why CBS settled a bullshit lawsuit by Trump against <em>60 Minutes</em> for $16 million. As former <em>60 Minutes</em> correspondent <a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/1201084/trump-cbs-news-60-minutes-steve-kroft-jon-stewart-daily-show/">Steve Kroft told Jon Stewart</a> (righteously, on Paramount-owned Comedy Central) regarding the “settlement”: “They never said, ‘We screwed up.’ They just paid the money. It was a shakedown, that’s what I call it. Some people call it extortion, that’s a legal term.”</p>

<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/02/media/how-secret-side-deal-helped-seal-paramounts-16m-settlement-with-trump/">The New York Post reported two weeks ago</a> that the official settlement is only half the deal, however:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shari Redstone’s Paramount received an unusual assist to settle
its controversial lawsuit with President Trump, which should now
clear the way for its long-awaited sale to independent studio
Skydance, On The Money has learned.</p>

<p>Skydance boss David Ellison, the son of Trump friend and
billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, stepped up and agreed
that once he takes control of the Tiffany Network, currently part
of Redstone’s flailing media empire, it will run between $15
million and $20 million of public service ads to promote causes
supported by the president, a source with knowledge of the
negotiations said.</p>

<p>“There is an anticipation of a mid-eight-figure sum that will be
allocated by the network to PSA advertisements and other broadcast
transmissions that support conservative causes supported by
President Trump,” the source said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It made no sense journalistically or financially for CBS to settle Trump’s lawsuit. <em>60 Minutes</em> clearly did nothing ethically wrong, let alone illegal, with its editing of Kamala Harris’s interview.<sup id="fnr1-2025-07-18"><a href="#fn1-2025-07-18">1</a></sup> It only makes sense as a de facto payoff to Trump to help secure approval of Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount. Likewise with CBS’s decision not just to part ways with Colbert as host, but to cease production of <em>The Late Show</em> entirely. It makes no TV sense. <em>The Late Show</em> isn’t just doing OK in the ratings, it’s the top show in the 11:30 timeslot. Here’s Jed Rosenzweig, <a href="https://latenighter.com/news/ratings/late-night-tv-ratings-q2-2025/">writing for LateNighter just four days ago</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the second quarter of 2025 wrapped, late-night’s pecking order
held mostly steady — with The Late Show with Stephen Colbert
topping the 11:35 PM hour in total viewers, and Late Night with
Seth Meyers leading at 12:37 AM across both key ratings metrics.</p>

<p>CBS’s <em>Late Show</em> was the only show among the nine tracked by
LateNighter to draw more total viewers in Q2 than it had in the
first quarter of 2025 — although just barely, with the show
growing its audience by 1% quarter over quarter. All told, the
Stephen Colbert-hosted show averaged 2.42 million viewers across
41 first-run episodes, comfortably outpacing ABC’s <em>Jimmy Kimmel
Live</em> (1.77 million) and NBC’s <em>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy
Fallon</em> (1.19 million). In the advertiser-coveted 18–49 demo,
however, Kimmel surged ahead with 220,000 viewers — his strongest
performance in a year — edging out Colbert (219,000) and leaving
Fallon (at 157,000) in a distant third.</p>

<p>At 12:37 AM, <em>Late Night With Seth Meyers</em> continued its quiet
reign. The NBC mainstay averaged 900,000 total viewers and
111,000 in the demo across 35 episodes — easily topping both
metrics in the late-late slot. ABC’s <em>Nightline</em> held second
place with 810,000 total viewers and 108,000 in the demo, putting
it ahead of CBS’s <em>After Midnight</em>, which ended its two-year run
in early June with an average of 591,000 total viewers and 89,000
in the 18–49 demo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Colbert’s <em>Late Show</em> is the highest-rated overall, and effectively tied with Kimmel in the advertiser-coveted 18–49 demo.<sup id="fnr2-2025-07-18"><a href="#fn2-2025-07-18">2</a></sup> Like all of traditional TV, late night viewership — and thus revenue — isn’t what it used to be. (For context, through the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s, Letterman and Leno <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2000/1/23/19487374/late-show-scores-ratings-victory-vs-leno/">each drew around 4–6 million viewers per night</a>. Johnny Carson averaged over 10 million viewers per night in the 1970s and 80s.) CBS declaring in its announcement that “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night” is obvious bullshit — and, <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2025/07/18/trump-gets-a-win-in-the-culture-wars/">in light of its timing</a>, extra stinky bullshit at that. Surely the top-rated show in late night isn’t just at least profitable, but almost certainly more profitable than whatever CBS might replace it with in that time slot. (CBS sources suddenly claim <em>The Late Show</em> <a href="https://puck.news/was-colberts-cancellation-really-economic-for-cbs/">lost $40 million last year</a>; <a href="https://latenighter.com/features/cbs-cites-costs-in-colbert-cancellation-the-timing-tells-a-different-story/">Bill Carter isn’t buying that</a> and neither should you.)</p>

<p>The TV industry has always been obsessed with ratings and obsessed with advertising revenue. I can’t recall the top-rated show in any category being cancelled. Again, it makes no TV sense. It doesn’t pass the sniff test. Back in December, regarding the Bezos-driven upheaval at The Washington Post, I wrote a piece titled “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/journalism_requires_owners_committed_to_the_cause">Journalism Requires Owners Committed to the Cause</a>”, which title sort of says it all. The only proper way to run a serious newspaper is for the work and reputation of the newspaper itself to be the topmost priority of everyone in leadership, right up to the owner. That’s just clearly not true for Bezos. And part of it too is that the entire business of The Washington Post just doesn’t matter to Bezos. Jeff Bezos has a net worth of around $230 <em>billion</em>. He bought the Post from its longtime owners, the Graham family (who <em>were</em> <a href="https://www.nyhistory.org/blogs/lets-go-lets-publish-katharine-graham-and-the-pentagon-papers">owners committed to the cause</a>) in 2013 for just $250 <em>million</em>. Financially, the entire Washington Post Company represents like one-thousandth of Bezos’s wealth. Trashing the paper’s reputation and the trust of its readers meant less to him than cozying up to Trump for potential trade policy favors for Amazon and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/jeff-bezos-trump-blue-origin-9f5ac75b?st=jo2tkC">rocketry deals for Blue Origin</a>.</p>

<p>It’s exactly the same for David Ellison. His father, Larry Ellison, is even wealthier than Bezos, with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/06/13/larry-ellison-40-billion-richer---surpassing-bezos-and-zuckerberg---as-oracle-stock-mounts-big-rally/">Forbes estimating his worth above $250 billion</a> after recent Oracle stock price gains. In normal times, with a normal US president (that is to say, not crooked), and a normal incoming buyer of a major television network (that is to say, concerned with ratings and ad revenue) it would be insane for the network to cancel the top-rated late night show just before the deal is finalized. But David Ellison doesn’t give a shit how much money CBS makes at 11:30 and doesn’t care about the three-decade legacy of The Late Show or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sullivan_Theater">the storied history</a> of the theater in which it’s produced each night. Cancelling this particular hit show isn’t poison to the deal for Skydance to buy Paramount — it’s a sweetener. I missed this at the time, but Oliver Darcy, media reporter extraordinaire, called it at Status (paywalled, alas) <a href="https://www.status.news/p/skydance-colbert-stewart-ellison">just over a week ago</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jon Stewart opened Monday’s episode of <em>The Daily Show</em> not
mincing words, calling Paramount’s settlement with Donald Trump
“shameful.” Just as he was digging in, a fake Arby’s ad suddenly
appeared on screen, as if to cut him off mid-rant for criticizing
Comedy Central’s parent company. “Did they? Son of a bitch!”
Stewart exclaimed, playing along with the bit — yet nodding to a
deeper fear that his commentary might soon be silenced amid all
the corporate upheaval.</p>

<p>Later in the episode, Stewart continued to needle Paramount,
sitting down with former <em>60 Minutes</em> correspondent Steve Kroft
for a candid and unsparing conversation. Kroft described the
settlement in clear terms: “It was a shakedown.” Inside “The Daily
Show,” I’m told staffers have taken pride that Stewart showed once
again he is willing to stand up to powerful interests, even if it
potentially risks his future employment. And while they may not
yet know it, inside certain power circles, there is an open
question: How much longer will Stewart have this platform?</p>

<p>Indeed, the reality is that the ground under not only Stewart, but
also Stephen Colbert, is shifting fast. Skydance, led by Larry and
David Ellison, now believes its merger with Paramount will close
in the next several weeks, I’m told. Much of the attention has
focused on how the Ellisons will reshape <em>60 Minutes</em> and CBS
News. We first reported that David Ellison met with Bari Weiss
about a possible role at CBS News, and it is clear the Ellisons
want to rid the network of what they see as a liberal taint. But
little has been said about the futures of Colbert and Stewart, who
have been two of Trump’s most consistent comedic antagonists,
under the new corporate leadership. [...]</p>

<p>As one media insider put it to me this week, “What better gift
could [the Ellisons] give Trump than to get rid of Colbert and
Stewart?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first shoe dropped at CBS last night. TV-wise, it’d be crazy for Paramount to drop Jon Stewart too. But dropping Colbert is even crazier, and they already did that. It’s not tyranny or the threat of state violence that is taking <em>The Late Show With Stephen Colbert</em> off the air, but rather oligarchy and unchecked cronyism and corruption. The breathtaking abdication we’re seeing at CBS — first news with <em>60 Minutes</em>, now commentary and humor with <em>The Late Show</em> — signals a decidedly American descent into <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Ecclesiastes%2010%3A20">curse-not-the-king</a> mass media acquiescence to Trump’s authoritarian hostility to criticism and dissent.</p>

<h2>Postscript</h2>

<p><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114874422468516376">Here’s Trump on his blog this morning</a>, heralding the news with his usual grace, equanimity, and factual accuracy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I absolutely love that Colbert’ [<em>sic</em>] got fired. His talent was even
less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less
talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them
combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great
Tonight Show.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will admit that it’s kind of funny that he didn’t even deign to address Fallon by name, especially since Fallon is the one who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGcosb22_Y">did the most</a> to normalize Trump’s aberrant candidacy in 2016.</p>

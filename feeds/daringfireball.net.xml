<p>In <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/03/alan-dye-leaves-apple-for-meta">my post earlier today</a> on the then-breaking news that Alan Dye has left Apple to join Meta as chief design officer (<a href="https://www.meta.com/media-gallery/executives/">a new title at the company</a><sup id="fnr1-2025-12-03"><a href="#fn1-2025-12-03">1</a></sup>), I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It sounds like Dye chose to jump ship, and wasn’t squeezed out (as
it seems <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/01/giannandrea-out">with former AI chief John Giannandrea</a> earlier this
week). Gurman/Bloomberg are spinning this like a coup for Meta
(headline: “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-03/apple-design-executive-alan-dye-poached-by-meta-in-major-coup">Apple Design Executive Alan Dye Poached by Meta in
Major Coup</a>”), but I think this is the best personnel news at Apple
in decades. Dye’s decade-long stint running Apple’s software
design team has been, on the whole, terrible — and rather than
getting better, the problems have been getting worse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dye’s replacement at Apple is longtime Apple designer Stephen Lemay. I’ve never met Lemay (or at least can’t recall meeting him), and prior to today never heard much about him. But that’s typical for Apple employees. Part of the job working for Apple is remaining under the radar and out of the public eye. What I’ve learned today is that Lemay, very much unlike Dye, is a career interface/interaction designer. Sources I’ve spoken to who’ve worked with Lemay at Apple speak highly of him, particularly his attention to detail and craftsmanship. Those things have been sorely lacking in the Dye era. Not everyone loves everything Lemay has worked on, but nobody bats 1.000 and designers love to critique each other’s work. I’ve chatted with people with criticisms of specific things Lemay has worked on or led at Apple (e.g. aspects of iPadOS multitasking that struck many of us as deliberately limiting, rather than empowering), but <em>everyone</em> I’ve spoken to is happy — if not downright giddy — at the news that Lemay is replacing Dye. Lemay is well-liked personally and deeply respected talent-wise. Said one source, in a position to know the choices, “I don’t think there was a better choice than Lemay.”</p>

<p>The sentiment within the ranks at Apple is that today’s news is almost too good to be true. People had given up hope that Dye would ever get squeezed out, and no one expected that he’d just up and leave on his own. (If you care about design, there’s nowhere to go but down after leaving Apple. What people overlooked is the obvious: Alan Dye doesn’t actually care about design.)</p>

<p>What I struggled with in the wake of today’s news is how to square the following contradiction:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dye apparently left for Meta on his own; he wasn’t squeezed out.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple replacing Dye with Lemay seemingly signals a significant shift in direction, replacing a guy whose approach was almost entirely superficial/visual with a guy who’s spent his entire career sweating actual interaction details.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If Apple’s senior leadership would have been happy to have Dye remain as leader of Apple’s software design teams, why didn’t they replace him with a Dye acolyte? Conversely, if the decision makers at Apple saw the need for a directional change, why wasn’t Dye pushed out?<sup id="fnr2-2025-12-03"><a href="#fn2-2025-12-03">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The answer, I think, is that the decision to elevate Lemay wasn’t about direction, but loyalty. Why risk putting in a Dye-aligned replacement when that person might immediately get poached too? We know, from this year’s AI recruitment battles, that Zuckerberg is willing to throw <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/06/18/metas-100-million-signing-bonuses-openai-staff-extreme-ai-talent-war/">almost unfathomable sums of money</a> to poach talent he wants to hire from competitors. Gurman reported that Billy Sorrentino, a Dye deputy who has served as a senior director of design at Apple since 2016, is leaving for Meta with Dye.<sup id="fnr3-2025-12-03"><a href="#fn3-2025-12-03">3</a></sup> I don’t have any other names, but word on the street is that other members of Dye’s inner circle are leaving Apple for Meta with him. But those who remain — or who might remain, if they’d have been offered the promotion to replace Dye — simply can’t be trusted from the perspective of senior leadership, who were apparently blindsided by Dye’s departure for Meta. They wouldn’t have given Dye a prime spot in the WWDC keynote if they thought he might be leaving within months.</p>

<p>So the change in direction we may see — that many of us desperately <em>hope</em> to see — under Lemay’s leadership might be happenstance. More a factor of Lemay being politically safe, as someone predating Dye and outside Dye’s inner circle at Apple, than from Tim Cook or anyone else in senior leadership seeing a <em>need</em> for a directional change in UI design. But happenstance or not, it could be the best thing to happen to Apple’s HI design in the entire stretch since Steve Jobs’s passing and Scott Forstall’s ouster.</p>

<p>Putting Alan Dye in charge of user interface design was the one big mistake Jony Ive made as Apple’s Chief Design Officer.<sup id="fnr4-2025-12-03"><a href="#fn4-2025-12-03">4</a></sup> Dye had no background in user interface design — he came from a brand and print advertising background. Before joining Apple, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/how-alan-dye-went-from-iphone-box-designer-to-apples-head-of-ui">he was design director for the fashion brand Kate Spade</a>, and before that worked on branding for the ad agency Ogilvy. His promotion to lead Apple’s software interface design team under Ive happened in 2015, when Apple was launching Apple Watch, their closest foray into the world of fashion. It might have made some sense to bring someone from the fashion/brand world to lead software design for Apple Watch, but it sure didn’t seem to make sense for the rest of Apple’s platforms. And the decade of Dye’s HI leadership has proven it.</p>

<p>The most galling moment in Dye’s entire tenure was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3KnMyojEQU">the opening of this year’s iPhone event keynote in September</a>, which began with a title card showing the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/01/23/how-it-works">oft-cited Jobs quote</a> “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” The whole problem with the Dye era of HI design at Apple is that it has so largely — not entirely, but largely — been driven purely by how things look. There are a lot of things in Apple’s software — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/07/tahoes-terrible-icons">like app icons</a> — that don’t even look good any more. But it’s the “how it works” part that has gone so horribly off the rails. Alan Dye seems like <em>exactly</em> the sort of person Jobs was describing in the first part of that quote: “People think it’s this veneer — that the designers are handed this box and told, ‘Make it look good!’”</p>

<p>I am not a Liquid Glass hater. I actually think, on the whole, iOS 26 is a better and more usable UI than iOS 18. But MacOS 26 Tahoe is a mess, visually, and I’m not sure there’s a single thing about its UI that is better than MacOS 15 Sequoia. There are <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/09/macos-26-tahoe-review-power-under-glass/">new software features in Tahoe</a> that are excellent and serve as legitimate enticements to upgrade. But I’m talking about the user interface — the work from Alan Dye’s HI team, not Craig Federighi’s teams. I think the fact that Liquid Glass is worse on MacOS than it is on iOS is not just a factor of iOS being Apple’s most popular, most profitable, most important platform — and thus garnering more of Apple’s internal attention. I think it’s also about the fact that the Mac interface, with multiple windows, bigger displays, and more complexity, demands more nuanced, more expert, interaction design skills. Things like depth, layering, and unambiguous indications of input focus are important aspects of any platform. But they’re more important on the platform which, by design, shoulders more complexity. Back in 2010, predicting a bright future for the Mac at a time when many pundits were thinking Apple would soon put the entire platform out to pasture, I wrote, “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/12/future_of_the_mac_in_an_ios_world">It’s the heaviness of the Mac that allows iOS to remain light</a>.” That remains as true today as it was 15 years ago. But Liquid Glass, especially as expressed on MacOS, is a lightweight poorly considered design system as a whole, and its conceptual thinness is not sufficient to properly allow the Mac to carry the weight it needs to bear.</p>

<p>Perhaps more tellingly, there should have been no need for the “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/21/ios-26-1-beta-4-liquid-glass-tinted-option">clear/tinted</a>” Liquid Glass preference setting that Apple added in the 26.1 OS releases. Alan Dye wasn’t fired, by all accounts, but that preference setting was as good a sign as any that he should have been. And it’s very much a sign that inside Apple, there’s a strong enough contingent of people who prioritize how things work — like, you know, <a href="https://x.com/Namelongnumbers/status/1996303867735375978">whether you can read text against the background of an alert</a> — to get a setting like this shipped, outside the Accessibility section of Settings.</p>

<p>It remains worrisome that Apple needed to luck into Dye leaving the company. But fortune favors the prepared, and Apple remains prepared by having an inordinate number of longtime talented HI designers at the company. The oddest thing about Alan Dye’s stint leading software design is that there are, effectively, zero design critics who’ve been on his side. The debate regarding Apple’s software design over the last decade isn’t between those on Dye’s side and those against. It’s only a matter of debating how bad it’s been, and how far it’s fallen from its previous remarkable heights. It’s rather extraordinary in today’s hyper-partisan world that there’s nearly universal agreement amongst actual practitioners of user-interface design that Alan Dye is a fraud who led the company deeply astray. It was a big problem inside the company too. I’m aware of dozens of designers who’ve left Apple, out of frustration over the company’s direction, to work at places like LoveFrom, OpenAI, and their secretive joint venture <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/21/sam-and-jony-io">io</a>. I’m not sure there are any experience designers at io who aren’t ex-Apple, and if there are, it’s only a handful. From the stories I’m aware of, the theme is identical: these are designers driven to do great work, and under Alan Dye, “doing great work” was no longer the guiding principle at Apple. If reaching the most users is your goal, go work on design at Google, or Microsoft, or Meta. (Design, of course, isn’t even a thing at Amazon.) Designers choose to work at Apple to do the best work in the industry. That has stopped being true under Alan Dye. The most talented designers I know are the harshest critics of Dye’s body of work, and the direction in which it’s been heading.</p>

<p>Back in June, after WWDC, I quoted from Alan Dye’s introduction of Liquid Glass during the keynote, and then quoted from <a href="https://youtu.be/dHrVGk0WwYM?t=381">Steve Jobs’s introduction of Aqua</a> when he unveiled the Mac OS X Public Beta in January 2000. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/some_brief_thoughts_and_observations_on_wwdc_2025">I wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Re-watching Jobs’s introduction of Aqua for the umpteenth time, I
still find it enthralling. I found Alan Dye’s introduction of
Liquid Glass to be soporific, if not downright horseshitty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the bits from Jobs’s Aqua introduction I quoted was this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is what the top of windows look like. These three buttons
look like a traffic signal, don’t they? Red means close the
window. Yellow means minimize the window. And green means maximize
the window. Pretty simple. And tremendous fit and finish in this
operating system. When you roll over these things, you get those.
You see them? And when you are no longer the key window, they go
transparent. So a lot of fit and finish in this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After I published that post, I got a note from a designer friend who left Apple, in frustration, a few years ago. After watching Jobs’s Aqua introduction for the first time in years, he told me, “I’m really struck by Steve directly speaking to ‘radio buttons’ and ‘the key window’.” He had the feeling that Dye and his team looked down on interface designers who used terms like Jobs himself once used — in a public keynote, no less. That to Dye’s circle, such terms felt too much like “programmer talk”. But the history of Apple (and NeXT) user interface design is the opposite. Designers and programmers used to — and still should — speak the exact same language about such concepts. Steve Jobs certainly did, and something feels profoundly broken about that disconnect under Alan Dye’s leadership. It’s like the head of cinematography for a movie telling the camera team to stop talking about nerdy shit like “f-stops”. The head of cinematography shouldn’t just abide talking about f-stops and focal lengths, but love it. Said my friend to me, regarding his interactions with Dye and his team at Apple, “I swear I had conversations in which I mentioned ‘key window’ and no one knew what I meant.”</p>

<p>That won’t be a problem with Stephen Lemay. Understanding of fundamental principles will no longer be lacking. Lemay has been at Apple spanning the gamut between the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/greg+christie">Greg Christie</a>/<a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/bas+ording">Bas Ording</a> glory days and the current era. At the very least, Lemay running HI should stop the bleeding — both in terms of work quality and talent retention. I sincerely believe things might measurably improve, but I’m more sure that things will stop getting worse. That alone will be a win for everyone — even though the change was seemingly driven by Mark Zuckerberg’s desire to poach Dye, not Tim Cook and Apple’s senior leadership realizing they should have shitcanned him long ago.</p>

<p>Alan Dye is not untalented. But his talents at Apple were in politics. His political skill was so profound that it was <em>his</em> decision to leave, despite the fact that his tenure is considered a disaster by actual designers inside and outside the company. He obviously figured out how to please Apple’s senior leadership. His departure today landed as a total surprise because his stature within the company seemed so secure. And so I think he might do very well at Meta. Not because he can bring world-class interaction design expertise — because he obviously can’t — but because the path to success at Meta has never been driven by design. It’s about getting done what Zuck wants done. Dye might excel at that. Dye was an anchor holding Apple back, but might elevate design at Meta.<sup id="fnr5-2025-12-03"><a href="#fn5-2025-12-03">5</a></sup></p>

<p>My favorite reaction to today’s news is <a href="https://x.com/8hipulin/status/1996318006335401997">this one-liner from a guy on Twitter/X</a>: “The average IQ of both companies has increased.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn1-2025-12-03">
<p>Titles are just titles, and title inflation is a real problem at all big companies. But I always thought C-level executives by definition report directly to the CEO. That that was the whole point of a “<em>chief whatever officer</em>” title versus “<em>senior vice president of whatever</em>”. But according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-03/apple-design-executive-alan-dye-poached-by-meta-in-major-coup">Mark Gurman’s exclusive report at Bloomberg</a> breaking this whole story (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the Dye hire, Meta is creating a new design studio and
putting him in charge of design for hardware, software and AI
integration for its interfaces. <em>He will be reporting to Chief
Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth</em>, who oversees Reality Labs.
That group is tasked with developing wearable devices, such as
smart glasses and virtual reality headsets. Dye’s major focus will
be revamping Meta’s consumer devices with artificial intelligence
features.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If true, Dye doesn’t even report directly to Mark Zuckerberg. Oddly enough, after <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/07/jeff_williams_is_retiring_as_coo">the retirement of CFO Jeff Williams</a> this year, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-announces-chief-operating-officer-transition/">Apple claimed</a> the company’s design teams transitioned to reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-12-03"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>
</li>


<li id="fn2-2025-12-03">
<p>And man oh man am I curious who was involved with this decision, who had Tim Cook’s ear, and just how quickly they were forced to make it. Part of what made Stephen Lemay a popular choice within Apple’s ranks is that Lemay, by all accounts I’ve heard, isn’t a political operator and never angled for a promotion to a level of this prominence. His focus has always singularly been on the work.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2025-12-03"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<li id="fn3-2025-12-03">
<p>Sorrentino was featured in a two-minute-plus segment in this year’s WWDC keynote, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/0_DjDdfqtUE?t=2305">starting at the 38:25 mark</a>, introducing the new iOS Visual Intelligence features. His star was rising at Apple. And Dye himself, of course, was given the spotlight to introduce and effectively take credit for Liquid Glass itself. At least until recently, no one at Apple saw this coming.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr3-2025-12-03"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>
</li>


<li id="fn4-2025-12-03">
<p>I have good reason to believe that Ive, in private, would be the first person to admit that. A fan of Liquid Glass Jony Ive is not. I believe he sees Dye as a graphic designer, not a user interface designer — and not a good graphic designer at that. I don’t think Alan Dye could get a job as a barista at LoveFrom.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr4-2025-12-03"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>
</li>


<li id="fn5-2025-12-03">
<p>It’s worth recalling that Zuckerberg sorta kinda tried this <em>poach-design-talent-from-Apple</em> thing before. Mike Matas, the wunderkind designer who became <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/26/delicious-library-eol">a sensation with Delicious Library in 2005</a>, soon thereafter <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2005/07/21/matas">moved on to work at Apple</a>, where he designed such things as the “slide to unlock” interface on the original iPhone. Matas was a key designer on that glorious first version of the iPhone’s OS. He then left Apple and formed Push Pop Press, and wound up at Facebook in 2011 after Facebook acquired Push Pop — before it had even shipped its core product. (I saw a still-in-development version of Push Pop’s publishing system in 2011, before Facebook bought them and shut down the product, and it remains to this day one of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2011/02/push_pop_press">the most impressive, exciting, “this is the future” demos</a> I’ve ever seen. It’s not merely a shame but a goddamn tragedy that it never even shipped.) Zuckerberg wound up assembling around Matas an entire little superteam of <a href="https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/11/06/the-delicious-generation/">“Delicious” era</a> designers and design-focused developers. That team wound up shipping <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/30/5360358/facebook-paper-iphone-app">Facebook Paper in 2014</a> — an iOS-exclusive alternative client for Facebook that espoused the same principles of elegance, exquisite attention to detail, and, especially, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/3/5373488/facebook-paper-app-review">direct manipulation of content in lieu of user interface chrome</a>, that infused Push Pop Press’s publishing system. Facebook Paper was so good it almost — <em>almost</em> — made me sign up for a Facebook account just so I could use it. But Facebook Paper went nowhere, fast. Zuckerberg lost his boner for “design”, Facebook Paper was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/06/30/facebook-paper-dead/">pulled from the App Store</a> in 2016, and the team behind Paper disbanded.</p>

<p>Matas today works at LoveFrom, and remains, to my mind, one of the most singularly talented and interesting people in the field of interaction design. In some closer-to-ideal alternate universe, Matas would be running HI design at Apple today.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr5-2025-12-03"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<p>Back in July, I was lucky enough to have my friend Louie Mantia <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/07/31/ep-428">on The Talk Show</a> to talk about Liquid Glass and (as I wrote in the show notes) “the worrisome state of Apple’s UI design overall”. This was probably my favorite episode of the show all year, and I think it holds up extremely well now that we’re all using Liquid Glass, across Apple’s platforms, in release versions.</p>

<p>Included in the show notes was a link to Mantia’s essay making his case against Dye’s decade-long stint leading Apple’s UI design teams, “<a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/a-responsibility-to-the-industry.html">A Responsibility to the Industry</a>”, which began thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Firstly, I maintain that it makes absolutely no sense that Alan
Dye has the power he has, because he simply has no taste. But
what’s worse is that he wields that power so clumsily, so
carelessly. And because it goes unchallenged, unchecked by someone
higher than him, the entire industry suffers the consequences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://pdx.social/@louie/115657549705092757">Here’s Mantia today</a>, regarding the news of Dye leaving Apple for Meta:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And good riddance!!</p>

<p>Tyler Hall, just one week ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe it’s because my eyes are getting old or maybe it’s because
<a href="https://tyler.io/2020/09/surtainly-not/#active-window">the contrast between windows</a> on macOS keeps getting worse.
Either way, I built a tiny Mac app last night that draws a border
around the active window. I named it “Alan”.</p>

<p>In Alan’s preferences, you can choose a preferred border width and
colors for both light and dark mode.</p>

<p>That’s it. That’s the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The timing of this is remarkably serendipitous — releasing an app named “Alan” to fix an obvious glaring design shortcoming in recent versions of MacOS just one week before Alan Dye left Apple. (<a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/12/03/alan-and-aaron/">See Michael Tsai</a> for more on the app’s name, including a callback to <a href="https://www.mymac.com/interview-greg-landweber/">Greg Landweber</a>’s classic Mac OS extension <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/538-aaron-1-x">Aaron</a>.)</p>

<p>It’s worth following Hall’s “the contrast between windows” link, which points to <a href="https://tyler.io/2020/09/surtainly-not/#active-window">his own post from five years ago</a> lamenting the decline in contrast between active and inactive windows in MacOS. That 2020 post of Hall’s refers back to Steve Jobs’s introduction of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard in 2007:</p>

<p>Jobs even <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/leopard-active-window.jpeg">prepared a slide</a>, highlighting “Prominent active window” as a noteworthy new feature. In 2007, the increase of visual prominence for the active window, going from 10.4 Tiger to 10.5 Leopard, drew applause from the audience. But the level of visual prominence indicating active/inactive windows was much higher <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2005/04/macosx-10-4/">in 10.4 Tiger</a> than in any version of MacOS in the last decade under Alan Dye’s leadership.</p>

  <p>I wish it did not feel understandable for there to be an app that
draws a big border around the currently active window. That should
be something made sufficiently obvious by the system.
Unfortunately, this is a problem plaguing the latest versions of
MacOS and Windows alike, which is baffling to me. The bar for what
constitutes acceptable user interface design seems to have fallen
low enough that it is tripping everyone at the two major desktop
operating system vendors.</p>

<p>Mark Gurman, with blockbuster news at Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meta Platforms Inc. has poached Apple Inc.’s most prominent design
executive in a major coup that underscores a push by the social
networking giant into AI-equipped consumer devices.</p>

<p>The company is hiring Alan Dye, who has served as the head of
Apple’s user interface design team since 2015, according to people
with knowledge of the matter. Apple is replacing Dye with longtime
designer Stephen Lemay, according to the people, who asked not to
be identified because the personnel changes haven’t been
announced.</p>

<p>Apple confirmed the move in a statement provided to
Bloomberg News.</p>

<p>“Steve Lemay has played a key role in the design of every major
Apple interface since 1999,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said
in the statement. “He has always set an extraordinarily high bar
for excellence and embodies Apple’s culture of collaboration and
creativity.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sounds like Dye chose to jump ship, and wasn’t squeezed out (as it seems <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-03/apple-design-executive-alan-dye-poached-by-meta-in-major-coup?embedded-checkout=true">with former AI chief John Giannandrea</a> earlier this week). Gurman/Bloomberg are spinning this like a coup for Meta (headline: “Apple Design Executive Alan Dye Poached by Meta in Major Coup”), but I think this is the best personnel news at Apple in decades. Dye’s decade-long stint running Apple’s software design team has been, on the whole, terrible — and rather than getting better, the problems have been getting worse.</p>

<p>Todd Vaziri, on the HBO Max <em>Mad Men</em> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/02/hbo-max-butchers-mad-men">fiasco</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It appears as though this represents the original photography,
unaltered before digital visual effects got involved. Somehow,
this episode (along with many others) do not include all the
digital visual effects that were in the original broadcasts and
home video releases. It’s a bizarro mistake for Lionsgate and HBO
Max to make and not discover until after the show was streaming to
customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tvaziri.com/post/3m6zcqcrzsc2a">I decided to help illustrate the changes</a> by diving in and
creating images that might do better than words. The first thing I
noticed is that, at least for season one, the episode titles and
order were totally jumbled. The puke episode is “Red in the Face”,
not “Babylon”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So HBO Max not only ruined several episodes by “remastering” the wrong footage, but they both mis-numbered <em>and</em> mis-titled the episodes. Breathtaking ineptitude. Think about it. This is the entire <em>raison d’être</em> — streaming high quality movies and episodic series. That’s the one and only thing HBO Max does. And they have zero care or craft for what they do. They didn’t just do this to <em>any</em> show. They did it to one of the most cinematically beautiful and carefully crafted shows ever made.</p>

<p>Vaziri’s post, as is his wont, is replete with illustrated and animated examples of the mistakes in HBO’s versions compared to the correct originals available from AMC and iTunes. Vaziri notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The fun thing about this restoration mistake is that now we, the
audience, get to see exactly how many digital visual effects were
actually used in a show like “Mad Men”</em>, which most would assume
did not have any digital effects component. In this shot, not only
were the techs and hose removed, but the spot where the pretend
puke meets Slattery’s face has some clever digital warping to make
it seem like the flow is truly coming from his mouth (as opposed
to it appearing through a tube inches from his mouth, on the other
side of his face).</p>

<p>Alan Sepinwall, writing for Wired (<a href="https://apple.news/A7hteXTouRPitd6GIpZuOfA">News+ link</a> in case Wired’s paywall busts your balls):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last month, HBO Max announced a major new addition to its library.
Not only would the streamer be adding <em>Mad Men</em> — a show that HBO
execs infamously passed on back when Matthew Weiner was a writer
on <em>The Sopranos</em> — but it would be presenting the period drama’s
episodes in a new 4K remastering. This would, according to the
<a href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/hbo-max/mad-men-comes-hbo-max-december-1">press release</a>, give “audiences and longtime <em>Mad Men</em> fans
the opportunity to enjoy the series’ authentically crafted
elements with crisp detail and enhanced visual clarity.”</p>

<p>As it turned out, there was perhaps <em>too much</em> clarity. Not long
after the series went live on HBO Max, a screencap began floating
around social media from a scene in the Season One episode “Red in
the Face,” where Roger Sterling is vomiting in front of a group of
horrified Sterling Cooper clients. When it aired — and in the
version still available on AMC+ — seven men are onscreen, all of
them wearing period-appropriate suits and ties. The HBO Max
version, on the other hand, features two men who appear very out
of place in 1960: crew members lurking in the background, feeding
a hose to create the illusion that actor John Slattery is puking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not like the crew members are only partially on-screen, or out of focus far in the background. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/mad-men-hbo-max-puke.jpeg">They’re right there</a>. It’s glaringly obvious that no one at HBO Max even watched this. That’s how rotten the culture at Warner Bros. Discovery is. They obtained the rights to one of the greatest TV shows ever made (one that I personally hold alongside <em>The Sopranos</em> as my favorite ever), processed the episodes in some sort of “remastering” <em>that did not need to happen</em>, and didn’t even bother to watch the fucking new versions they produced before putting them on their service for the world to stream.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amcplus.com/mad-men">AMC+ has the entire original series</a>, as originally broadcast, and it looks gorgeous. I bought <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/mad-men/umc.cmc.260bmp43ucaq656rs0tw6aioj">all seven seasons from iTunes</a> back in the day, and they look as good, if not better, in those versions. David Zaslav — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/13/zaslav-hbo-max.php">a well-known idiot</a> — should go to prison for this.</p>

<p>Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil, reporting for Reuters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple does not plan to comply with a mandate to preload its
smartphones with a state-owned cyber safety app and will
convey its concerns to New Delhi, three sources said, after
the government’s move sparked surveillance concerns and a
political uproar.</p>

<p>The Indian government has confidentially ordered companies
including Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi to preload their phones with
an app called Sanchar Saathi, or Communication Partner, within 90
days. The app is intended to track stolen phones, block them and
prevent them from being misused.</p>

<p>The government also wants manufacturers to ensure that the app is
not disabled. And for devices already in the supply chain,
manufacturers should push the app to phones via software updates,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/india-orders-mobile-phones-preloaded-with-government-app-ensure-cyber-safety-2025-12-01/">Reuters was first to report on</a> Monday. [...]</p>

<p>Apple however does not plan to comply with the directive and will
tell the government it does not follow such mandates anywhere in
the world as they raise a host of privacy and security issues for
the company’s iOS ecosystem, said two of the industry sources who
are familiar with Apple’s concerns. They declined to be named
publicly as the company’s strategy is private.</p>

<p>The second source said Apple does not plan to go to court or take
a public stand, but it will tell the government it cannot follow
the order because of security vulnerabilities. Apple “can’t do
this. Period,” the person said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To my knowledge, there are no government-mandated apps pre-installed on iPhones anywhere in the world. I’m not even sure how that would work, technically, given that third-party apps have to come from the App Store and thus can’t be installed until after the iPhone is configured and the user signs into their App Store Apple Account.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The app order comes as Apple is locked in a court fight with an
Indian watchdog over the nation’s antitrust penalty law. Apple has
said it risks facing a fine of up to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-contests-indias-antitrust-penalty-law-with-risk-38-billion-fine-filing-2025-11-26/">$38 billion in a case</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is another one of those laws like the EU’s DMA, where maximum <em>possible</em> fines are based on a percentage of global revenue. No one in India seems to actually be threatening any such fine, but it’s ludicrous that it’s even possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/01/giannandrea-out">Speaking of</a> Apple executive HR news, in his Power On Bloomberg column last weekend, Mark Gurman pooh-poohed <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/15/ft-apple-tim-cook-succession">the Financial Times’s recent report</a> that Tim Cook was likely to retire early next year (paywalled, alas, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/23/gurman-on-tim-cook-remaining-apple-ceo/">summarized by MacRumors</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In October, I wrote that the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-10-05/who-will-be-apple-s-next-ceo-after-tim-cook-apple-shelves-vision-air-m5-ipad">internal spotlight on Ternus was
“intensifying,”</a> and that barring unforeseen circumstances
he would be the leading candidate. But I didn’t put a date on when
a change might happen. Then, around midnight two Fridays ago, the
Financial Times published a report with three central claims:
Apple is “intensifying” succession planning; Ternus is likely the
next CEO; and Cook is expected to step down between late January
and June.</p>

<p>The first two points are anything but revelations if you’ve read
Bloomberg coverage and Power On, or have simply been paying
attention to the realities of Cook’s age and tenure. The timing,
however, is another matter entirely. It’s a huge deal that the FT
did this: A respected publication should only predict the CEO
transition date for a company of Apple’s scale with a high level
of confidence — based on people legitimately in the know.</p>

<p>This is where I have concerns. Based on everything I’ve learned in
recent weeks, I don’t believe a departure by the middle of next
year is likely. In fact, I would be shocked if Cook steps down in
the time frame outlined by the FT. Some people have speculated
that the story was a “test balloon” orchestrated by Apple or
someone close to Cook to prepare Wall Street for a change, but
that isn’t the case either. I believe the story was simply false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can’t both be right. Either the Financial Times or Bloomberg and Gurman will have a serving of claim chowder no later than June. But as Gurman points out, the only disagreement in their reporting is regarding timing: soon vs. soon-ish.</p>

<p>It could be that we see something like the following next year. Current board chairman Arthur Levinson turned 75 this year, the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/01/26/apple-will-be-on-the-hunt-for-two-new-board-members-soon">suggested age limit</a> for Apple Board members. So maybe he rides off into the sunset and Apple names Cook, who already has a seat on the board, executive chairman. Maybe in February, ahead of Apple’s annual shareholder meeting. Then, in the second half of the year, Cook steps down as CEO, Ternus takes the CEO job, and Cook remains chairman of the board for the next decade or so. One change at a time, with a drip-drip series of leaks to trusted business news publications, like the one to the Financial Times last month — seemingly from the board itself — to make none of it come as a surprise.</p>

<p>I don’t think the leak — from multiple sources — to the FT was a “test balloon” (cue John Siracusa on <a href="https://atp.fm/666">ATP 666</a> regarding “<em>trial</em> balloon” being the correct idiom). It was more of a “<em>heads up, this is what’s coming</em>”.</p>

<p>Apple Newsroom, “John Giannandrea to Retire From Apple”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced John Giannandrea, Apple’s senior vice
president for Machine Learning and AI Strategy, is stepping down
from his position and will serve as an advisor to the company
before retiring in the spring of 2026. Apple also announced that
renowned AI researcher Amar Subramanya has joined Apple as vice
president of AI, reporting to Craig Federighi. Subramanya will be
leading critical areas, including Apple Foundation Models, ML
research, and AI Safety and Evaluation. The balance of
Giannandrea’s organization will shift to Sabih Khan and Eddy Cue
to align closer with similar organizations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">the fiasco around Apple Intelligence and the “more personalized Siri” features</a> — which were announced at WWDC in June 2024, but postponed until 2026 in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">a tail-between-their-legs announcement in March 2025</a> — and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/gurman-rockwell-siri">the executive reshuffling immediately after that delay was announced</a> that put Mike Rockwell in charge of Siri and moved all or most of Apple Intelligence and Siri under Craig Federighi, it would have been much more surprising if Giannandrea had stayed at Apple. In fact, I’m surprised he wasn’t out before WWDC this past June.</p>

<p>I don’t think we need to wait for additional details to know that he was squeezed out. If, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-20/apple-vision-pro-chief-mike-rockwell-named-siri-head-giannandrea-keeps-ai-role">as Mark Gurman reported back in March</a>, “Tim Cook has lost confidence in the ability of AI head John Giannandrea to execute on product development”, why was he still there?</p>

<p>As for Subramanya, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amar-subramanya-3642498a/">according to his LinkedIn profile</a>, he was at Google for 16 years, and left to join Microsoft <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amar-subramanya-3642498a_super-excited-to-share-that-ive-started-activity-7353453746091081729-ElkV">only five months ago</a>. Either he didn’t like working at Microsoft, or Apple made him an offer he couldn’t refuse (or, perhaps, both).</p>

	<summary type="text">A user-hostile “lose your phone, lose your account history” architecture may well be “secure” in a technical sense, but it’s the sort of brittleness that’s kept Signal from achieving more mainstream use.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/9708267671322-Signal-Secure-Backups">Signal Support</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Signal Secure Backups can help you safely restore your chats
if something unexpected happens to your device (like dropping
your phone in a lake). When this optional feature is enabled,
your device will automatically back up your message history so
you won’t lose important data if you get a new phone or
reinstall Signal.</p>

<p>Your Secure Backup Archive is end-to-end encrypted and protected
by a cryptographically secure 64-character recovery key that is
never shared with the Signal service. Without your unique recovery
key, no one (including Signal) can read, decrypt, or restore any
of the data in your Secure Backup Archive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Signal’s cloud storage service is optional (of course), and available to all users free of charge. At the free tier, it will back up the complete text of users’ chat history and the last 45 days of file attachments (images, video, etc.). For $2/month (through in-app purchase in the iPhone app), Signal will remove the 45-day window on media attachments, and store up to 100 GB of attachments — which, for most users, should be their complete history. (I don’t remember how far back in time my iCloud iMessage storage goes, but, as I type this, it includes 772,004 messages and consumes 83.4 GB of storage. I have a <em>lot</em> of images in there. 100 GB of storage feels pretty good for $2/month. My personal Signal account backup size is just 408 MB, which jibes with my gut feeling regarding how much I use Signal compared to iMessage — about one-half of one percent as much.)</p>

<p><a href="https://signal.org/blog/introducing-secure-backups/">Signal first announced this feature back in September</a> in a blog post that has a lot of technical details about how it works, but <a href="https://x.com/signalapp/status/1993018186690871409">until a week ago</a>, it was only available on the Android version. It’s still labelled as a “beta” feature on iOS. I enabled it over the weekend and signed up for the $2/month subscription — both to back up all my attachments and to support the Signal Foundation. Now that I’m paying $2/month, however, I wish they’d stop periodically badgering me for donations when I launch the app.</p>

<p>I’m glad this feature became available when it did, and that I enabled it over the weekend. Yesterday I set up my personal new iPhone this year, and this morning, when I tried to transfer my Signal account from my old iPhone to the new one, after claiming to reach “100%” of the transfer, and the Signal app reporting on both the old (source) and new (destination) phones that the transfer was complete, the app crashed on both phones. After that, the Signal app was in factory-fresh state on both phones, without any trace of my account history. I then restored the new iPhone from my brand-new online Signal Secure Backup, and that worked perfectly. And it somehow took far, far less time than the old device-to-device transfer — maybe one minute, versus 15 minutes or so for the device-to-device transfer that wound up failing.</p>

<p>Until now, transferring my Signal account history from one phone to another always felt like delivering a crate full of eggs while riding a rickety old bicycle without brakes on a bumpy cobblestone street. Every time I did it device-to-device, it felt like I’d be lucky if it worked. And my experience trying it this morning — for the last time — proved me right. Signal proponents often defended this architecture by arguing that remaining only on device was a security benefit. In some ways that’s true, but there’s nothing “secure” about a transfer feature that loses all of your data if the transfer fails. (Signal data, by design, isn’t included in iCloud backups because Apple holds a key to unlock iCloud backups for customer service reasons, unless the user has enabled <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756">Advanced Data Protection</a>.) Permanently losing all your data is a different form of “insecurity” than having it exfiltrated by an attacker or exposed to law enforcement agencies via a warrant issued to the cloud backup provider, but it’s a form of insecurity nonetheless.</p>

<p>Signal’s top priority has always been protecting your data from being obtained by others. That’s a noble idea, and central to Signal’s brand. But by placing that priority so far above everything else, it meant, until now, that you’d lose your entire account history if you lost or broke your primary phone. This new secure backup system shows that your data can remain secure while also being backed up off device. I’m glad the feature is finally here, but it should have been here years ago. A user-hostile “lose your phone, lose your account history” architecture may well be “secure” in a technical sense, but it’s the sort of brittleness that’s kept Signal from achieving more mainstream use.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/05/festivitas">Last year</a> developer Simon Støvring launched a fun new app for the Mac called Festivitas, which let you decorate your menu bar and Dock with animated holiday lights and falling snow.

<p>Sam Roberts, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>David Lerner, a high school dropout and self-taught computer geek
whose funky foothold in New York’s Flatiron district, Tekserve,
was for decades a beloved discount mecca for Apple customers
desperate to retrieve lost data and repair frozen hard drives,
died on Nov. 12 at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 72. [...]</p>

<p>Tekserve specialized in finding the cures for sick computers — including insect infestations — and recovering first novels and
other priceless data, which the company said it was able to do
about 85 percent of the time.</p>

<p>“We only charged for success,” Mr. Lerner said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were many great independent Apple resellers from the pre-Apple-Store era. There was only one that was legendary: Tekserve.</p>

<p>Regarding my earlier post on similarities between the 2010 App Store Guidelines and today’s: Notably absent from the current guidelines (I think for a very long time) is the specious but very Jobsian claim that “If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps.” Getting the press on your side is one of the <em>best</em> ways for a developer to get an unjust App Store review decision overturned. Apple <em>loathes</em> negative publicity.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Here’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#design">the updated full guideline for section 4.1</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4.1 Copycats</p>

<p>(a) Come up with your own ideas. We know you have them, so make
    yours come to life. Don’t simply copy the latest popular app
    on the App Store, or make some minor changes to another app’s
    name or UI and pass it off as your own. In addition to risking
    an intellectual property infringement claim, it makes the App
    Store harder to navigate and just isn’t fair to your fellow
    developers.</p>

<p>(b) Submitting apps which impersonate other apps or services is
    considered a violation of the Developer Code of Conduct and
    may result in removal from the Apple Developer Program.</p>

<p>(c) You cannot use another developer’s icon, brand, or product
    name in your app’s icon or name, without approval from the
    developer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s guideline (c) that’s new, but I like guideline (a) here. Not just the intent of it, but the language. It’s clear, direct, and human. It reminds me of the tone of the very early guidelines, when it seemed like Steve Jobs’s voice was detectable in some of them. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/09/app_store_guidelines">In a post back in 2010, I wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This new document is written in remarkably casual language. For
example, a few bullet items from the beginning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li><p>We have over 250,000 apps in the App Store. We don’t need any
more Fart apps.</p></li>
<li><p>If your app doesn’t do something useful or provide some form of
lasting entertainment, it may not be accepted.</p></li>
<li><p>If your App looks like it was cobbled together in a few days, or
you’re trying to get your first practice App into the store to
impress your friends, please brace yourself for rejection. We
have lots of serious developers who don’t want their quality
Apps to be surrounded by amateur hour.</p></li>
<li><p>We will reject Apps for any content or behavior that we believe
is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court
Justice once said, “I’ll know it when I see it”. And we think
that you will also know it when you cross it.</p></li>
<li><p>If your app is rejected, we have a Review Board that you can
appeal to. If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of that language remains today. Here’s the current guideline for section 4.3:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4.3 Spam [...]</p>

<p>(b) Also avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated;
    the App Store has enough fart, burp, flashlight, fortune
    telling, dating, drinking games, and Kama Sutra apps, etc.
    already. We will reject these apps unless they provide a
    unique, high-quality experience. Spamming the store may lead
    to your removal from the Apple Developer Program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could be wrong, but my sense is that Apple has, without much fanfare, cracked down on scams and rip-offs in the App Store. That doesn’t mean there’s none. But it’s like crime in a city: a low amount of crime is the practical ideal, not zero crime. Maybe Apple has empowered something like the “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/bunco+squad">bunco squad</a>” I’ve wanted for years? If I’m just unaware of blatant rip-offs running wild in the App Store, send examples my way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence">Amazon Alexa with AI</a> has the same basic problem of
all AI bots, it acts as if it’s human, with a level of intimacy
that you really don’t want to think about, because Alexa is in
your house, with you, listening, all the time. Calling attention
to an idea that there’s a pseudo-human spying on you is bad. Alexa
depends on the opposite impression, that it’s just a computer. I

	<summary type="text">The bottom line is that users setting up new Apple Watches in the EU will now get a somewhat slightly worse experience in the name of parity with accessories made by third-party companies. It remains to be seen whether users of third-party iPhone accessories and peripherals in the EU will see any benefit at all.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>There have been several new features that have been delayed in the EU while Apple tried to make them compliant with the DMA. iPhone Mirroring <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120421">debuted over a year ago with iOS 18 and MacOS 15 Sequoia</a>, but still remains unavailable today in the EU. Apple Intelligence <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/01/apple-intelligence-is-now-fully-supported-in-the-eu-with-ios-18-4/">was delayed in the EU until iOS 18.4</a> in April, but was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-releases-ios-18-1/">available to most of the world in 18.1</a> last October. And, both most recently and briefly, the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/123185">live translation feature</a> for AirPods Pro 3, AirPods Pro 2, and AirPods 4, which debuted outside the EU with the launch of iOS 26.0 in September, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ie/newsroom/2025/11/live-translation-on-airpods-expands-to-the-eu/">will only become available in the EU next month</a>, with the launch of iOS 26.2.</p>

<p>But now comes word of the first feature that Apple is limiting or removing in an existing product to comply with the DMA: Wi-Fi network sync between iPhone and Apple Watch, which is poised to change in the EU next month, with the 26.2 releases of iOS and WatchOS. The news was broken by Nicolas Lellouche, <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/2110247-lapple-watch-et-liphone-vont-perdre-une-fonction-en-europe-pour-la-premiere-fois-annonce-apple.html">reporting for the French-language site Numerama</a>. I’m quoting here from Safari’s English translation of his original report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has been warning for several months that it could one day,
if it deems it necessary, disable functions in the European Union
to “protect its users”. This day could arrive in December, with
the iOS 26.2 update.</p>

<p>On November 4, Apple announced to Numerama that it had made the
decision to disable Wi-Fi synchronization between an iPhone and an
Apple Watch in Europe so as not to have to comply with the
European Commission’s request, which wants to force it by the end
of 2025 to open the iPhone’s Wi-Fi to third-party accessories.
This announcement follows the opening of the AirPods Live
Translation function in Europe, with a new API to allow
competitors to use the microphones and speakers of AirPods and
iPhone simultaneously. [...]</p>

<p>Apple indicates that the European Commission is asking it to
replicate the link between an iPhone and an Apple Watch, but with
third-party products. Apple, after thinking long about how to
implement this function, finally decided to reject the European
request. Since Europe requires that third-party products be
treated like the Apple Watch, then Apple disables the function on
Apple Watch. This allows it to comply with the DMA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lellouche’s report at Numerama broke this story (the reports at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/06/iphone-apple-watch-wi-fi-sync-eu-ios/">MacRumors</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/05/ios-26-2-will-remove-a-key-iphone-and-apple-watch-feature-in-eu-per-report/">9to5Mac</a> are both based on Numerama’s), but the above is not an accurate summary of what Apple is doing with iOS 26.2.<sup id="fnr1-2025-11-22"><a href="#fn1-2025-11-22">1</a></sup> Apple <em>is</em> complying with the DMA, and they’re <em>not</em> disabling Wi-Fi network synchronization between an iPhone and a paired Apple Watch. What Apple is doing, in order to comply with the DMA, is changing how Wi-Fi networks sync with Apple Watch (in the EU), and offering new APIs in the EU for third-party paired devices to put them on equal (or near-equal?) footing with Apple Watch (in the EU).</p>

<p>This change should be relatively limited. Honestly, I don’t think many Apple Watch users in the EU will even notice. But it is at least mildly annoying, and the relatively minor, very specific nature of this particular DMA mandate makes it a telling example of the European Commission’s overreach.</p>

<p>Currently, when you pair a new Apple Watch with an iPhone, iOS transfers to WatchOS the iPhone’s entire list of saved Wi-Fi networks and their passwords — directly, device-to-device. As iOS learns of new networks that the user joins from their iPhone, that information continues to be shared with any Apple Watches paired to that iPhone. The utility of this is that if you’re wearing your Apple Watch, but don’t have your iPhone nearby, your watch will join an available saved Wi-Fi network at your location. Let’s say you go for a run or walk, with only your Apple Watch, and you stop at a cafe for a beverage. If you’ve ever joined the Wi-Fi network at that cafe from your iPhone (or iPad or Mac, assuming you sync your Apple Keychain via iCloud), your Apple Watch will join that network automatically. It should, and in my personal experience does, just work.</p>

<p>The EU mandate to Apple is <em>not</em> that Apple must grant to third-party devices and their iOS companion applications this same functionality as it stands today — that is to say, access to the entire history of the iPhone’s known Wi-Fi networks. The EU mandate is that Apple must grant to third-party devices the same level of access to Wi-Fi network information that Apple Watch has. Apple is complying with this mandate in two ways: (a) by changing how much Wi-Fi network information an Apple Watch gets from the iPhone to which it is paired; and (b) creating a new framework in iOS 26.2 (gated by a new entitlement), <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/wifiinfrastructure">Wi-Fi Infrastructure</a>, that provides a set of public APIs, available only to apps in the EU, to (per the framework’s description) “share Wi-Fi network credentials securely between devices and connected accessories.”</p>

<p>The change for Apple Watch in the EU is that starting with iOS 26.2, when a new (or reset) Apple Watch is set up, the Apple Watch will no longer have the user’s list of saved Wi-Fi networks automatically synced from their iPhone. Only future networks will be synced — the same level of access that the new Wi-Fi Infrastructure framework is making available to third-party accessories.</p>

<p>Under the new rules for Apple Watch in the EU, an existing (that is to say, already configured) watch that is upgraded to WatchOS 26.2 will still remember all Wi-Fi networks it already knew about. But a new Apple Watch will only be able to automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks that its associated iPhone saves <em>after</em> the Apple Watch was set up and paired. So when an EU Apple Watch owner with a new watch visits a known location, and doesn’t have their iPhone with them, the watch won’t be able to join that location’s Wi-Fi automatically, unless the paired iPhone has connected to and saved that network <em>after</em> the watch was paired.</p>

<p>With iOS 26.2, the behavior for users outside the EU will remain unchanged from iOS 26.1 and prior — both for Apple Watch and for third-party accessories.</p>

<p>A user’s Wi-Fi history can be used to glean significant information about them. Who they know (other homes’ networks), where they’ve been (medical providers, restaurants, airports), and more. Apple’s new policy for Apple Watch and third-party devices is DMA-compliant and prevents the sharing of historical networks, but with the sharing of future networks as the associated iPhone joins them, there’s still a risk here of third-party companies doing things with the user’s Wi-Fi network information that the user doesn’t understand, or want (but doesn’t realize they’ve consented to).</p>

<p>One way to look at Apple’s options for complying with this particular DMA mandate is by considering the extremes. On the one extreme, Apple could have just granted third-party peripherals in the EU the exact same access to users’ iPhone Wi-Fi network history that Apple Watch has gotten until now (and will continue to get outside the EU). On the other extreme, Apple could have cut off Wi-Fi network syncing to the Apple Watch altogether, requiring users to connect to each Wi-Fi network manually, using the Watch itself or the Apple Watch app on iPhone. Instead, Apple chose a middle ground — limiting Wi-Fi network history sync to the Apple Watch in the EU in ways that it isn’t limited anywhere else in the world, but granting third-party accessories in the EU access to these new Wi-Fi Infrastructure APIs that aren’t available outside the EU.</p>

<p>Critics might argue that while this middle ground is technically compliant with the DMA, it’s not compliant with the <em>intention</em> of the DMA, which would be for the Apple Watch not to lose any functionality in the EU, and for Apple to provide APIs to allow third-party devices all of the Wi-Fi syncing features currently available to Apple Watch. Apple would argue, and I agree, that the European Commission’s intentions are incoherent in this regard. The EC insists that Apple should protect users’ privacy and security, while also insisting that Apple grant access to third-party apps and devices that can potentially compromise users’ privacy and security.</p>

<p>There’s a reason why Apple isn’t offering the new Wi-Fi Infrastructure framework outside the EU, and that’s because they don’t believe it’s a good idea to grant any access at all to your saved Wi-Fi networks to third-party apps and devices. Especially without being able to specify, let alone enforce, a policy that Wi-Fi network information should be treated the way Apple treats it — remaining exclusively on device.</p>

<p>The skeptical take on Apple’s motivations in this situation is that Apple is spitefully removing functionality from Apple Watch rather than offering new APIs to provide third-party devices with the same functionality that Apple Watch currently has, and that Apple’s intention here is, somehow, primarily about trying to drive anti-DMA sentiment amongst its EU users. This is, in fact, the skeptical take on every single aspect of Apple’s compliance with the DMA: spiteful “malicious compliance” that, somehow, is intended to engender grassroots opposition to the DMA amongst Apple customers in the EU. I don’t think that’s an accurate take overall, but in this particular case with Apple Watch and Wi-Fi network sync, it’s almost silly.</p>

<p>Part of what makes this particular situation clarifying is that it’s so specific. It’s not about allowing third-party devices and their corresponding iOS apps to do <em>everything</em> that Apple Watches, and the Apple Watch iOS companion app, can do. It’s very specifically about the sharing of known Wi-Fi networks. (There will, surely, be other such situations to come regarding other features, for other Apple devices.) And as I described above, very few Apple Watch owners in the EU are likely to notice the change. How many Apple Watch users today realize that their watch automatically connects to known Wi-Fi networks when their iPhone is outside Bluetooth range?</p>

<p>If Apple were motivated by spite, and were trying to turn EU Apple Watch owners against the DMA, they’d just remove all Wi-Fi network syncing between the watch and its paired iPhone. Not just the historical list of all networks the iPhone has ever connected to, but the continuous sync of new networks the iPhone joins after the Apple Watch is paired. <em>That</em> would be a change Apple Watch users would be more likely to notice. But it’s not what Apple is doing. They’ve engineered an entire framework of public APIs to comply with the EC’s mandate.</p>

<p>But the reporting to date on this situation, starting with Numerama, paints the picture that Apple <em>is</em> dropping all Wi-Fi sync between WatchOS and iOS in the EU, and that Apple is refusing to make Wi-Fi network information available to third-party accessories.</p>

<p><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/11/06/ios-26-2-to-remove-iphone-apple-watch-wi-fi-sync-in-eu/">Here’s Michael Tsai</a>, after quoting from Tim Hardwick’s summary at MacRumors of Numerama’s report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems perfectly reasonable that if I have a third-party watch I
should be able to opt into having my phone share Wi-Fi info with
it. You can debate whether mandating this is the proper role of
government, but the status quo is clearly anti-competitive and bad
for the user experience. I’m open to hearing a story where Apple’s
position makes sense, but so far it just seems like FUD to me.
What is the argument, exactly? That Fitbit, which already has its
own GPS, is going to sell your access point–based location
history? That Facebook is going to trick you into granting access
to their app even though they have no corresponding device?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tsai is making a few wrong assumptions here. First, Apple <em>is</em> enabling users (in the EU) to opt into having their iPhone share Wi-Fi information with third-party devices. Second, this mandate is not specific to smartwatches — it applies to any devices that can pair with an iPhone and have corresponding iOS partner apps. So Meta, with their lineup of smartglasses, <em>does</em> have corresponding devices. And, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-slams-metas-numerous-interoperability-requests-2024-12-18/">per Apple’s public statements</a>, it is Meta in particular that has been zealously pursuing interoperability mandates pursuant to the DMA. I think it’s entirely possible that this entire issue regarding Wi-Fi network sharing was prompted by Meta’s interoperability requests to the European Commission.<sup id="fnr2-2025-11-22"><a href="#fn2-2025-11-22">2</a></sup></p>

<p>As for the argument regarding why Apple has chosen to comply in this way, what is essential to note is that <em>none</em> of this Wi-Fi network information shared between iOS and WatchOS <em>is ever sent to or seen by Apple</em>. Apple doesn’t see the network passwords, doesn’t see the names of the networks, and doesn’t even know when a device has joined a new network. All of this is exclusively on-device, and when the information is exchanged between an iPhone and paired Apple Watch, it’s transferred device-to-device. (This is also true when you use Apple’s features to share Wi-Fi passwords with nearby friends. It’s device-to-device and entirely private and secure. Apple doesn’t even know that person A sent a Wi-Fi password to person B, let alone know the name of the network or the password.)</p>

<p><a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/links/2025/11/07/0732">Here’s Rui Carmo, at Tao of Mac</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As someone who relies a lot on the Watch (especially now that
WhatsApp works locally on it), I’d say we have officially reached
the point where Apple is on the verge of actively harming their
user experience for no good reason whatsoever. I honestly don’t
know if this is bull-headedness or malicious compliance.</p>

<p>On the other hand, someone at the EU clearly prefers being in the
limelight by regulating against evil US corporations in ways that
affect very small parts of the general population rather than,
say, go after Asian smart TV manufacturers that are present in
millions of homes and resell data on Europeans’ TV viewing habits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No notes on Carmo’s second point. But regarding the first, his opinion is founded on incorrect assumptions. Apple clearly thinks it’s a bad idea to share any Wi-Fi information at all with third-party devices, but they’ve created an entire new framework for use within the EU to allow it, just so they can continue syncing any Wi-Fi network information at all with Apple Watch. Far from harming the user experience, Apple is bending over backwards to make the Apple Watch experience as good as possible while balancing the privacy and security implications of this DMA mandate. Rather than take away all Wi-Fi network syncing, Apple is leaving most of it in place, and only eliminating (in the EU) the part at the very beginning, where, during the set up process, all of the current networks saved on the iPhone are synced to the Apple Watch.</p>

<p>Given the mandate regarding the DMA, and given the privacy implications of sharing any of this information with third-party developers and peripheral makers, personally, I think it would have been reasonable for Apple to take the extreme position of simply disallowing Wi-Fi network information syncing to any and all devices, including Apple Watches, in the EU. There is no reason to trust third-party developers with any of this information. But Apple isn’t doing that, and they’ve undertaken a significant software engineering effort — just for the EU — to support the path they’ve chosen. Carmo’s critique seems predicated on the assumption that Apple is just cutting off all Wi-Fi network sharing.</p>

<p>Given that Apple’s compliance needs to account for potentially untrustworthy device makers — whether by <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/08/23/meta-lawsuit-settlement-facebook-location-tracking">intent</a>, or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/portable-lifeprint-printer-app-on-ios-and-android-leaked-millions-of-user-photos-and-sensitive-data-this-is-what-we-know">incompetence</a> — not syncing all known networks seems like a reasonable trade-off.</p>

<p>Leave it to <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1986222627003023630?s=20">Tim Sweeney to espouse the maximalist perspective</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why simply not ask the user whether or not to share WiFi history
identically whether connecting to an Apple product or a Meta
product?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, in fact, what Apple is doing. But the privacy implications for a user are, in fact, different when an iPhone’s saved Wi-Fi networks are shared to, say, a Meta product than to another Apple product. It’s worth emphasizing that the European Commission’s mandate does not permit Apple to require those third-party companies to treat this information with the same privacy protections that Apple does. Apple keeps that information exclusively on-device, but Apple is not permitted to require third-party peripheral makers to do the same.</p>

<p>Consider <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102420">the iOS system prompt for App Tracking Transparency</a>: the user’s two choices are “Ask App Not to Track” and “Allow”. It’s a common and natural question why the first option is “Ask App Not to Track” rather than “Don’t Allow”. It would certainly look better if the options were “Don’t Allow” and “Allow”. But Apple deliberately made the first button “Ask App Not to Track” because ATT is, at least partially, a <em>policy</em>, not a complete technical guarantee. If an app prompts for ATT permission and the user chooses “Ask App Not to Track”, that app should definitely <em>not</em> go ahead and attempt to track the user’s activity across other apps. But, technically, it could try.<sup id="fnr3-2025-11-22"><a href="#fn3-2025-11-22">3</a></sup> I presume that if they do, if and when Apple notices, Apple will rap the developer’s knuckles in the App Store review process, or even suspend the app’s developer account. But one can see why Apple would want to avoid <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/facebook-and-google-offered-gift-cards-for-root-level-access-to-ios-users-data/">such a pissing match with Facebook/Meta again</a>.<sup id="fnr4-2025-11-22"><a href="#fn4-2025-11-22">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Under the EU’s mandate to Apple regarding Wi-Fi network access for third-party devices and their corresponding iOS apps, Apple is not permitted even to set a policy that these apps must pinky swear to keep the information private and on-device. Nor is the EU itself demanding it. If a third-party device-maker wants to send your iPhone’s Wi-Fi network history and credentials to their servers and save it, that’s up to them, <em>not</em> Apple, per the EC. Apple sees that as a problem.<sup id="fnr5-2025-11-22"><a href="#fn5-2025-11-22">5</a></sup> You can argue — and some will, as I think Michael Tsai does in the passage I quote above, and as Tim Sweeney clearly does — that this ought to be up to the user. If a user says they’re fine with their Wi-Fi network information being shared with a third-party accessory they’ve paired with their iPhone, that’s up to them. That is a reasonable take. But I also think Apple’s perspective is reasonable as well — that they should be able to make products where this isn’t possible.</p>

<p>The “it should be up to the user” take benefits informed, technically savvy users. The “it shouldn’t be possible” take benefits uninformed, un-savvy users — users who in many cases have decided that they simply trust Apple. The iPhone brand message — the brand message behind the Apple ecosystem — is that Apple doesn’t allow things that are dangerous to security or privacy. I do not think most iPhone users expect a third-party device they pair to their iPhone to be able to send their entire history of Wi-Fi networks back to the company that made the device. (Most iPhone users also don’t realize how sensitive, privacy-wise, their complete Wi-Fi network history is.)</p>

<p>It’s fair to point out that the “it should be up to the user” take is more beneficial to third-party accessory makers than the “it shouldn’t be possible” take. And that this conflict of interest — where the same limitations that protect iPhone users’ privacy by definition disadvantage third-party devices in ways that Apple’s own devices that connect to iPhones are not — works not just in iPhone users’ favor, privacy-wise, but also in Apple’s favor, financially. Apple can sell more Apple Watches if they work better with iPhones than smartwatches from other companies do. That’s obviously true, but that’s just another way of saying that first-party products have inherent advantages that third-party products don’t, to which I say: <em>Duh</em>. Apple’s own peripherals, like Apple Watch, can do things that third-party peripherals can’t because Apple can trust its own devices, and its own software, in ways that it can’t trust devices and companion apps made by other companies.</p>

<p>It’s natural for a company to bootstrap a new product on the back of an existing successful one. Meta’s Threads social network, for example, uses the same usernames and sign-in system as Instagram, which is arguably the most successful social network in the world. Should Meta not have been permitted to do that? Or should they be forced to allow <em>anyone</em> to create new competing social networks using Instagram user accounts as the ID system?</p>

<p>It’d be pretty weird if Apple limited itself, when designing and engineering features that integrate experiences across <em>its own</em> devices, to what it would allow third-party developers to do. It’d be even weirder if Apple allowed third-party developers to do everything Apple’s own software can do.<sup id="fnr6-2025-11-22"><a href="#fn6-2025-11-22">6</a></sup></p>

<p>For at least the last <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/nack_control">15 years</a>, I’ve <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Adaringfireball.net%20apple%27s%20priorities%3A%20apple%20first%2C%20users%20second%2C%20developers%20third&amp;udm=14">repeatedly</a> emphasized that Apple’s priorities <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut">are in this order</a>: Apple first, users second, developers third. The DMA attempts to invert that order, privileging developers first (in the ostensible name of fair competition with Apple, a designated “gatekeeper”), ahead of users, and ahead of Apple itself. So of course Apple is going to object to and resist mandates that require it to subordinate its own strategic desires — its own sense of how its products ought to be designed and engineered — especially when the primary beneficiary of the mandates aren’t users, but developers. Many of whom, especially the larger ones, are Apple’s competitors. But I also think it’s clear, with Apple in particular, that users prefer Apple’s priorities. People are happier with Apple putting users’ considerations ahead of developers’ than they are when developers are free to run roughshod over the software platform.</p>

<p>The clearest example of that is the App Store. It’s overwhelmingly developers, not users, who object to the App Store model — the exclusivity of distribution, the exclusivity of the vendor’s payment system, the vendor’s payment commissions, the vendor’s functional guidelines and restrictions, all of it. Users largely don’t have a problem with any of that. That’s why Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/files/DMA-Study-Nov-2025.pdf">commissioned and then publicized a study</a>, just this month, that showed that DMA-driven changes saved developers €20 million in commissions, but that reduction in commissions didn’t lower the prices users pay. Developer-focused observers <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-dma-commission-study/">see that as a win for the DMA</a> — that’s €20 million in developers’ pockets that otherwise would have gone into Apple’s already overflowing pockets. But a user-focused observer might see that as clarifying regarding the fact that the DMA wasn’t designed to benefit users, and isn’t benefiting users in practice either. Apple doesn’t care about €20 million. They fart bigger than that. They do care about clarifying who the DMA prioritizes first, and that it’s not users. (And, of course, that it’s not Apple itself.)</p>

<p>Users love the App Store model. With Apple in particular, users, by and large, <em>like</em> the idea that the platforms have stringent guardrails. Many buy iPhones <em>because</em> Apple exerts such control over the platform, not <em>despite</em> it. But that control is exactly why Apple has been so singularly targeted by the European Commission regarding DMA mandates, despite the fact that Samsung by itself — let alone the Android platform as a whole — <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/smartphone_market_in_europe_slips_2_premium_phone_sales_on_the_rise-news-67978.php">sells more phones in Europe</a> (and <a href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/global-smartphone-share">the world</a>) than Apple does.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that users setting up new Apple Watches in the EU will now get a slightly worse experience in the name of parity with accessories made by third-party companies. It remains to be seen whether users of third-party iPhone accessories and peripherals in the EU will see any benefit at all (because the companies that make their devices will need to adopt these new EU-exclusive Wi-Fi Infrastructure APIs in their iOS companion apps) — and, if the users of third-party iPhone accessories <em>do</em> see the benefit of Wi-Fi network information syncing to their devices, whether their privacy will be respected. But don’t make the mistake of thinking that Apple is complying the least bit spitefully with regard to this mandate.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Meta will actually use the new Wi-Fi Infrastructure framework to allow their accessories, like their <a href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/">AI Glasses</a>, to obtain Wi-Fi network information from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meta-ai-vibes-ai-glasses/id1558240027">Meta’s companion iOS app</a>. I’m guessing they almost certainly would, if the Wi-Fi Infrastructure APIs were available globally. But these APIs are exclusive to the EU. Will Meta deem it worth the engineering effort to support this feature only for users in the EU? We shall see.</p>
<p>It’s worth remembering that one of the initial DMA mandates the EU issued to Apple was that iOS must support third-party web browser rendering engines, and to comply with this, Apple spent significant (and I suspect that’s a vast understatement) engineering resources to create the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-browser-engines/">BrowserEngineKit and BrowserEngineCore</a> frameworks, and here we are at the end of 2025, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/111820566793853249">nearly two years after Apple shipped those frameworks</a>, and there are exactly zero browsers on iOS using alternative rendering engines. Zero. These frameworks might be the largest set of APIs ever created that never get used. I wouldn’t be surprised if the new Wi-Fi Infrastructure framework sees the same fate. (Meta might consider that a win, just knowing that Apple had to expend this effort for naught.)&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2025-11-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<li id="fn3-2025-11-22">
<p>Apple has a good layperson-approachable <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">overview of App Tracking Transparency</a>. At a technical level, an app must prompt for and receive the user’s permission (via the Allow button in the system-provided ATT prompt) in order to access the device’s advertising identifier. From that document: “Unless you receive permission from the user to enable tracking, the device’s advertising identifier value will be all zeros and you may not track them as described above.”</p>
<p>But returning zeroes for the device’s advertising identifier doesn’t technically prevent a devious developer from attempting to uniquely identify and track the user by other means. If the button in the system prompt said “Don’t Allow”, rather than “Ask App Not to Track”, it would imply that Apple could guarantee the app isn’t tracking you (or trying to track you) without your permission. Apple can’t guarantee that, so they don’t imply that they can.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr3-2025-11-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn4-2025-11-22">
<p>I’m not aware of any instances where an app has been accused of disregarding the ATT “Ask App Not to Track” request, but surely it has happened. If you’re aware of any such accusations, and how Apple responded, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/contact/">let me know</a>.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr4-2025-11-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn5-2025-11-22">
<p>I’m not arguing here that the European Commission doesn’t care about user privacy, or that I think the European Commission doesn’t realize that Wi-Fi network information is quite sensitive. I’m sure they do care about user privacy and do realize that Wi-Fi network information is privacy-sensitive. What I do think is that the European Commission believes the privacy of this information should only be guarded by law, and that they already have laws in place that protect such information. And thus it’s not Apple’s place — especially now that they’ve been deemed a “gatekeeper” that has the power to stymie competition — to attempt to protect that information, whether by technical limitations or by policy.</p>

<p>Apple is certainly not opposed to privacy-protecting laws, in the abstract, but doesn’t see the law alone as protection enough. Apple’s perspective is that protecting their customers’ privacy is, in fact, Apple’s responsibility — and one of their most important responsibilities at that. It’s illegal to steal cars, but every carmaker still puts locks on the doors and requires a key to start the engine. In numerous ways, Apple sees the DMA as mandating, privacy-wise, that they create something akin to cars that don’t require keys, trusting EU law to keep them from being stolen. The European Commission only sees Apple’s protections as blocking would-be competitors, not would-be privacy thieves.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr5-2025-11-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn6-2025-11-22">
<p>In the old days, of course, with devices designed before the iPhone, this wasn’t weird. All software, whether first- or third-party, could do whatever it wanted to. Anyone could write a kernel extension. In the classic Mac OS days there was no “kernel” and we just had “extensions” and you could just drop one in your Extensions folder, restart, and boom, whatever system extension you just installed was now effectively part of the operating system. Any app could read and write anything on disk, including into the operating system. Go back far enough and apps could read <em>and write</em> (deliberately or accidentally) inside the memory of another running application. To split personal computing — not just PCs but all personal computing devices, in the plain sense of the words — into three eras, there was (1) the early era when all software was effectively “root”; (2) the middle era, still exemplified today by MacOS and Windows, when there were user-controlled protections on what could run as root; and (3) the modern era, as exemplified by iOS and stock Android, where the <em>vendor</em> controls what can run as root.</p>

<p>You can reasonably make the case — and expert-level users (read: nerds) often do — that the user should always be in control. <em>I bought the device, I should be able to run whatever software, with whatever privileges, I want.</em> That perspective is valid, but it also describes a class of devices — PCs — that privilege the autonomy of third-party developers over the vendor-controlled stability of the OS. The PC model, where accessory makers can offer software that runs with root (or root-like) escalated privileges, offers significantly greater opportunities for third-party accessory makers than the mobile model, where accessories are limited to whatever public APIs are provided by the device vendor for integration. But with the PC model, users can “mess up” their system by installing software they shouldn’t have, or that they regret having installed but don’t know how to remove. With the mobile model, users are technically prevented from installing anything that could “mess up” their system. It’s always about trade-offs. And with this particular trade-off, it’s very clear which model is more successful in the market. It’s not feasible to make computers intended for use by anyone and everyone which require any degree of technical knowledge or expertise to manage.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr6-2025-11-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

  <p>The Hikawa Phone Grip &amp; Stand is a MagSafe compatible adaptive
accessory for iPhone designed by Bailey Hikawa to celebrate the
40th anniversary of accessibility at Apple. Designed with direct
input from individuals with disabilities affecting muscle
strength, dexterity, and hand control, this ergonomic grip was
designed with accessibility in mind from the ground up. The grip
uses magnets to securely snap onto any iPhone with MagSafe, can be
removed with ease, and doubles as a stand to support iPhone at two
different viewing angles, both vertically and horizontally.
Inspired by modern sculpture, each Hikawa product is an art object
unto itself. The limited edition Hikawa Phone Grip &amp; Stand is
available in two colors, a bold, high-visibility Chartreuse and
recycled Crater, exclusive to Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like a perfectly cromulent accessory, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/11/hikawa-chartreuse.jpeg">Chartreuse</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/11/hikawa-crater.jpeg">Crater</a> are both a bit out there — in different ways — to be the only two color options. Or, I should say, <em>were</em> a bit out there. Both are already sold out from Apple.</p>

<p>I’m not quite sure what’s limited about the Chartreuse, given that Hikawa’s website <a href="https://www.baileyhikawa.com/products/wavy-triangle-grip-stand-in-chartreuse">still lists it as “ready to ship”</a> along with pre-orders for <a href="https://www.baileyhikawa.com/products/hikawa-adaptive-grip-stand-in-cobalt">Cobalt</a> and <a href="https://www.baileyhikawa.com/products/wavy-triangle-grip-stand-in-chartreuse-copy">Blurple Swirl</a> (whose URL seems a bit rushed).</p>

<p>Amusing to see Apple partner with a company whose main products alongside iPhone cases are <a href="https://www.baileyhikawa.com/collections/toilet-seats">fanciful toilet seats</a>.</p>

<p>“Carol Sturka”, actress Rhea Seehorn’s fictional protagonist of the new Apple TV series <em>Pluribus</em>, is on Reddit right now — at 12n ET / 9am PT — doing an AMA in character. Sturka is a fantasy novelist, and Apple Books has <a href="https://books.apple.com/us/book/bloodsong-of-wycaro/id6754341665">an 11-page excerpt of her “new” novel <em>Bloodsong of Wycaro</em></a>. Unclear whether it’s Seehorn writing the in-character responses, but it’s definitely Seehorn in the confirmation photo. Reminiscent of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/16/severance-balloon-generator">some of the promotional fun</a> Apple has had for <em>Severance</em>.</p>

<p>Both my wife and I are loving <em>Pluribus</em> so far. I highly recommend watching the first episode without even knowing the premise, if you can.</p>

<p>The Steve Jobs Archive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To mark <em>Toy Story</em>’s 30th anniversary, we’re sharing a
never-before-seen interview with Steve from November 22, 1996 — exactly one year after the film debuted in theaters.</p>

<p><em>Toy Story</em> was the world’s first entirely computer-animated
feature-length film. An instant hit with audiences and critics, it
also transformed Pixar, which went public the week after its
premiere. Buoyed by <em>Toy Story</em> ’s success, Pixar’s stock price
closed at nearly double its initial offering, giving it a market
valuation of approximately $1.5 billion and marking the largest
IPO of 1995. The following year, <em>Toy Story</em> was nominated for
three Academy Awards en route to winning a Special Achievement
Oscar in March. In July, Pixar announced that it would close its
television-commercial unit to focus primarily on feature films. By
the time of the interview, the team had grown by 70 percent in
less than a year; <em>A Bug’s Life</em> was in production; and behind the
scenes, Steve was using his new leverage to renegotiate Pixar’s
partnership with Disney.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kind of a weird interview. The video quality is poor, and whoever was running the camera zoomed in and out awkwardly. It’s like ... just a VHS tape? But it’s also weird in a cool way to get a “new” Steve Jobs interview in 2025, and Jobs, as ever, is thoughtful and insightful. Well worth 23 minutes of your time.</p>

<p>There’s a particularly interesting bit at the end when Jobs discusses how Pixar was half a computer company (with extraordinary technology) and half a movie studio (with extraordinary filmmaking talent), but eventually they had to choose between the two industries for how to pay their employees to motivate them to remain at Pixar. The Hollywood way would be with contracts; the Silicon Valley way would be with stock options. Jobs chose the Silicon Valley path for Pixar.</p>

<p>Anthony Castrovince, reporting for MLB.com on the new broadcast rights agreement that will cover the next three seasons of baseball:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sunday Night Baseball will shift from ESPN, where it aired since
1990, to NBCUniversal, which also secured the rights to Sunday
Leadoff and the Wild Card Series in the postseason for NBC and
Peacock.</p>

<p>Netflix will now air the T-Mobile Home Run Derby, an Opening Night
exclusive and special event games set to include the 2026 MLB at
Field of Dreams Game and the World Baseball Classic in Japan.</p>

<p>And ESPN will receive a national midweek game package throughout
the season while also acquiring the rights to sell MLB.TV, the
league’s out-of-market streaming service that set a record with
19.4 billion minutes watched in 2025. [...]</p>

<p>FOX/FS1 will continue to be the home of the All-Star Game and
regular season games, as well as the World Series, League
Championship Series, and Division Series presented by Booking.com.
TBS will continue to house LCS and Division Series telecasts, plus
regular season games on Tuesday nights. Apple TV will continue to
stream “Friday Night Baseball” doubleheaders throughout the
regular season.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back in August, <a href="https://x.com/kendallbaker/status/1957930701086679514">Kendall Baker of Yahoo Sports reported</a>:</p>

<p>Miguel Arroz, on Mastodon:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unpopular opinion, apparently: companies like Cloudflare and
Amazon provide very high quality services people and enterprises
actually need, with a level of uptime and security vastly superior
to what most of their customers would achieve on their own or
using traditional providers. Their downtimes being so visible is a
consequence of their success.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few readers have (very politely!) asked me whether yesterday’s outage (which made DF unreachable for, I think, about 90 minutes) made me rethink relying on a centralized provider like Cloudflare. My answer is no.</p>

<p>Until I started using Cloudflare in 2018, Daring Fireball relied on no upstream service. I paid for a server from a web hosting provider (those providers changed a few times over the years), and when you, a reader, requested a page on this site, your browser communicated directly with my server via HTTP requests and my server responded directly back. The basic architecture of the World Wide Web is beautifully simple, and I embraced that simplicity with the way I hosted and served Daring Fireball.</p>

<p>But the move away from HTTP to HTTPS added a lot of complexity. That complexity is probably worth it, overall, but it came at the price of simplicity. I originally made the switch to using Cloudflare as a caching front-end for Daring Fireball as a solution to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/09/df_slowdown">an SSL-related slowdown that affected only some visitors</a> in 2018. But I’d started using Cloudflare to handle my DNS the year before.</p>

<p>Daring Fireball has always been a fast website and has always had very good uptime. That’s not because the back end is <em>cleverly</em> architected, but rather because it’s so <em>simply</em> architected. But DF’s overall uptime and the frequency of any sort of performance problems went from good to great when I started relying on Cloudflare as a proxy. Also, in recent years, bot traffic has exploded. (Thanks, AI.) I’m pretty sure my server could handle those bursts of traffic on its own, but I sleep better not having to worry about it, because Cloudflare handles <a href="https://www.manton.org/2025/11/19/this-report-from-matthew-prince.html">mind-boggling amounts</a> of traffic.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The issue was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a cyber
attack or malicious activity of any kind.</em> Instead, it was
triggered by a change to one of our database systems’ permissions
which caused the database to output multiple entries into a
“feature file” used by our Bot Management system. That feature
file, in turn, doubled in size. The larger-than-expected feature
file was then propagated to all the machines that make up our
network.</p>

<p>The software running on these machines to route traffic across our
network reads this feature file to keep our Bot Management system
up to date with ever changing threats. The software had a limit on
the size of the feature file that was below its doubled size. That
caused the software to fail.</p>

<p>After we initially wrongly suspected the symptoms we were seeing
were caused by a hyper-scale DDoS attack, we correctly
identified the core issue and were able to stop the propagation
of the larger-than-expected feature file and replace it with an
earlier version of the file. Core traffic was largely flowing as
normal by 14:30. We worked over the next few hours to mitigate
increased load on various parts of our network as traffic rushed
back online. As of 17:06 all systems at Cloudflare were
functioning as normal.</p>

<p>We are sorry for the impact to our customers and to the Internet
in general. Given Cloudflare’s importance in the Internet
ecosystem any outage of any of our systems is unacceptable. That
there was a period of time where our network was not able to route
traffic is deeply painful to every member of our team. We know we
let you down today.</p>

<p>This post is an in-depth recount of exactly what happened and what
systems and processes failed. It is also the beginning, though not
the end, of what we plan to do in order to make sure an outage
like this will not happen again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything about this incident exemplifies why Cloudflare is one of my favorite companies in the world. Ideally, it wouldn’t have happened, but shit does happen. Among the things to note about Cloudflare’s response:</p>

<ul>
<li>They identified and fixed the issue quickly.</li>
<li>They issued frequent updates to <a href="https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/">their status site</a> while the incident remained ongoing.</li>
<li>They published this postmortem within 24 hours. (That’s remarkable, given the technical breadth of the postmortem. Publishing this tomorrow, within 48 hours of the incident, would have been a praise-worthy accomplishment.) <strong>Update:</strong> Actually, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45978769">according to Prince</a>, commenting on Hacker News, the postmortem was published less than 12 hours after the incident began. Amazing.</li>
<li>The postmortem starts with a cogent, well-written layperson’s explanation of what happened and why.</li>
<li>The postmortem expands to include very specific technical details, including <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@mttaggart/115573489086885199">source code</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, it’s worth noting that Prince put his own name on the postmortem (and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45974320">wrote much of it himself</a>, using BBEdit), and closed with this apology, taking personal responsibility:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An outage like today is unacceptable. We’ve architected our
systems to be highly resilient to failure to ensure traffic will
always continue to flow. When we’ve had outages in the past it’s
always led to us building new, more resilient systems.</p>

<p>On behalf of the entire team at Cloudflare, I would like to
apologize for the pain we caused the Internet today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is how it’s done.</p>

<p>The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world’s richest man. One of the world’s most famous soccer
players. The president of soccer’s governing body. Dozens of
executives from the finance, tech and energy sectors. These are
some of the guests who attended President Trump’s black-tie dinner
for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia at the White
House on Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>The red carpet welcome for Prince Mohammed is an extraordinary
moment in diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. It is his first
visit to the United States since the 2018 killing of the
Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/us/politics/jamal-khashoggi-killing-cia-report.html">U.S.
intelligence determined the prince ordered</a>. Prince
Mohammed has denied involvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yours truly, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">back in August</a>, after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9DrCgWtOUw">Tim Cook’s Oval Office gift of gold to Trump</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is disturbing to think that the leader of a beloved, trusted,
and widely believed-to-be-ethical company like Apple has succumbed
to avarice. That Tim Cook feels no qualms about — or perhaps even
delights in — participating in a quid-pro-quo-driven corrupt
administration in which flattery, fealty, gifts, and
barely-concealed bribes are rewarded. That the United States
devolving into kleptocracy suits Tim Cook just fine, because
Apple’s pockets are deep enough to pay the vig.</p>

<p>But the alternative is more disturbing.</p>

<p>What if Tim Cook is, in fact, strong, proud, and driven by a keen
sense of moral and ethical clarity? Perhaps Cook declined Trump’s
invitation to join his Middle East entourage in May only because
he was otherwise busy. But I believe there are bridges he will not
cross — and that trip, especially its implicit and explicit
praise and sanctification of the Saudi regime in general, and MBS
in particular, was one of them. The whole trip was grotesque, and
made a mockery of traditional American values.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MBS being feted <em>in the White House</em> is even more grotesque.</p>

<p>Jonathan V. Last, writing for The Bulwark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The president of the United States gave a speech yesterday before
a group of McDonald’s corporate workers and franchise owners. I’m
going to quote a few sections of his remarks at great length,
because if you have not listened to Trump speaking recently, the
decline in his cognitive abilities is a bit shocking.</p>

<p>The point of this exercise is not to clown on Trump, but to give
everyone a baseline understanding of where he is, with the
mentals, as we try to understand how he will respond to increasing
pressures in the coming months.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPid-oVSSi4">The video of his remarks is here</a> and I’ll include timestamps
for each section, in case you want to see what he looks and
sounds like.</p>

<p>Bottom line: This is a man in noticeable mental decline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole world is inured to listening to Trump speak like this — it sounds normal even to those of us who see that Trump is spiraling into dementia. <em>Ah, that’s just Trump being Trump.</em> But it’s not normal. Reading the transcript is jarring. Also jarring: listening to <a href="https://www.threads.com/@decodingfoxnews/post/DRMQaNzjqsY">Juliet Jeske’s performative reading</a> of a particularly nonsensical portion of Trump’s McDonald’s speech.

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>President Donald Trump, today in the Oval Office alongside his “very good friend” Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, after ABC News reporter <a href="https://www.threads.com/@iamarslan/post/DRNc3f9kmh-">Mary Bruce had the temerity to pose a question</a> regarding Mohammed having ordered the brutal murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People are wise to your hoax. ABC, your company, your crappy
company, is one of the perpetrators. And I’ll tell you something,
I think the license should be taken away from ABC because your
news is so fake, and it’s so wrong. And we have a great
commissioner, a chairman, who should look at that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also from Trump, regarding Khashoggi’s murder:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking
about. Whether you like him or didn’t like him, things happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things happen, indeed.</p>

<p>Disney (ABC’s owner), a year ago <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/16/nx-s1-5230274/abc-settles-with-trump-for-15-million-now-he-wants-to-sue-other-news-outlets">settled a lawsuit Trump filed against ABC News</a> — a lawsuit most experts agreed <a href="https://fair.org/home/abc-settles-with-trump-in-a-case-it-could-have-won/">ABC would have won</a> — for $16 million, <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/the-great-fluffening-of-2024/sharetoken/b6e8708a-fc8b-4ae4-8843-9cc9c009f969">in what clearly amounted to a bribe</a>.</p>

<p>Yours truly, last month, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/07/hodges-cook-iceblock">in a post on Apple’s capitulation to Trump regarding the ICEBlock app for iOS</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you give a bully your lunch money, they always come back
for more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Bob Iger <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/09/24/kimmel-returns">gets that now</a>. “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/03/fuck-you-make-me">Fuck you, make me</a>” remains the correct response to these threats.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mark Gurman, in his (paywalled, alas) Power On column for Bloomberg over the weekend:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-31/apple-tests-new-high-end-mac-chips-ahead-of-developer-conference">next major update</a> didn’t arrive until 2023, when Apple
finally transitioned the desktop to in-house chips with the M2
Ultra Mac Pro. Two years later, that model remains largely
unchanged. And it’s been overshadowed by the Mac Studio, which
received the M3 Ultra chip earlier this year while the Mac Pro
stayed put.</p>

<p>Now here’s the bad news: That <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-09/apple-iphone-satellite-plans-image-texting-third-party-apps-low-cost-macbook-mhrq10p2">doesn’t look set</a> to change
anytime soon. There’s no longer an M4 Ultra in the works (a Mac
Pro to support it was also nixed), and the next high-end desktop
chip will be the M5 Ultra. So far, Apple is only focused on a new
Mac Studio for the processor. That suggests the Mac Pro won’t be
updated in 2026 in a significant way.</p>

<p>From what I’ve heard inside the company, Apple has largely written
off the Mac Pro. The sentiment internally is that the Mac Studio
now represents both the present and future of Apple’s professional
desktop strategy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/?modelList=MacPro-m2-ultra,Mac-Studio-M3-Ultra,MacBook-Pro-14-M4-Pro">Here’s a comparison</a> of the now-two-year-old M2 Ultra Mac Pro with the M3 Ultra and M4 Max Mac Studios. I’d love to see Apple pursue some sort of M# Extreme chip that goes above and beyond the M# Ultra variants, but unless they do, there’s not much point to a 32-pound suitcase-sized enclosure that offers little more than the Studio’s small 8-pound enclosure. The difference mostly comes down to the Pro’s internal PCI Express expansion slots, but those slots don’t support third-party GPUs from Nvidia or AMD — and likely never will.</p>

<p>London Centric:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sam was walking past a Royal Mail depot in south London in January
when his path was blocked by a group of eight men.</p>

<p>“I tried to move to let them pass, but the last guy blocked the
path,” the 32-year-old told London Centric. “They started pushing
me and hitting me, telling me to give them everything.”</p>

<p>The thieves took Sam’s phone, his camera and even the beanie hat
off his head. After checking Sam had nothing else on him, they
started to run off.</p>

<p>What happened next was a surprise. With most of the gang already
heading down the Old Kent Road, one turned around and handed Sam
back his Android phone.</p>

<p>The thief bluntly told him why: “Don’t want no Samsung.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, despite the fact that the iPhone-Android market share split is around 50-50 in the UK. It’s that the iPhone overwhelmingly attracts people who care about their phone. Android attracts the people who don’t care. It’s the same reason why the Mac has, for decades now, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2013/04/pricing_and_profit_consistency_and_the_halo_effect">dominated the profit share of the PC industry</a> while garnering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share_of_personal_computer_vendors">only about 10 percent unit-sale share</a>. It’s also why it’s major news <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/13/tesla-carplay">that Tesla is testing CarPlay support</a>, and not news at all that they’re <em>not</em> testing Android Auto support. “Don’t want no Samsung” indeed.</p>

	<summary type="text">The question is, did Meta scrap its native Windows app because they don’t care that much about Windows in particular? Or because they don’t care that much about native desktop apps, period — and a crude web app wrapper is coming to Mac next?</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/11/12/meta-just-killed-native-whatsapp-on-windows-11-now-it-opens-webview-uses-1gb-ram-all-the-time/">Mayank Parmar, writing for Windows Latest</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WhatsApp on Windows 11 has just got a “major” upgrade, and you’re
probably going to hate it because it simply loads web.whatsapp.com
in a WebView2 container. This means WhatsApp on Windows 11 is
cooked, and it’s back to being absolute garbage in terms of
performance.</p>

<p>WhatsApp is one of those Windows apps that went from being a web
wrapper to a native app and then back to the web again after all
these years of investment. WhatsApp for Windows was originally an
Electron app, and it was eventually replaced with UWP after years
of investment. Four years later, WhatsApp is going back to
WebView2, abandoning the original WinUI/UWP native idea. [...]</p>

<p>An app can use a lot of memory, and it does not necessarily mean
it’s a performance nightmare, but the issue with the new WhatsApp
is that it feels sluggish. You’re going to notice sluggish
performance, long loading time, and other performance issues when
browsing different conversations.</p>

<p>We also noticed that it does not work well with Windows
notifications. It also struggles with Windows 11’s Do Not Disturb
mode or Active Hours. And there are delayed notifications problems
as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found this post interesting on a few fronts.</p>

<p>First, from the perspective of Meta. They replaced a shitty web app wrapper for Windows with a modern native Windows app, one that seemingly pleased Windows aficionados like Parmar. And now they’ve thrown that app away, going back to what that native app replaced four years ago: a web app wrapper that is bloated, slow, and unsurprisingly has poor support for native Windows features. It’s bad enough that so many large companies never even bother creating native apps, but it feels even worse to see a good native app abandoned.</p>

<p>Second, it’s interesting reading Parmar’s list of gripes about the new web-app-wrapper WhatsApp app. All his gripes have merit, but it struck me that none of them are about the UI. Maybe the web app’s UI is actually fine? I have no idea. But I suspect it’s more that the Windows nerd mindset has UI design quality and adherence to recommended platform idioms way down on their list of priorities. That’s why they’re Windows users, not Mac users.</p>

<p>Lastly, I wonder if this bodes poorly for the future of the current <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997">WhatsApp app for MacOS</a>, a native app written using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/mac-catalyst">Mac Catalyst</a>, Apple’s framework for porting iOS UIKit apps to the Mac. Like most Catalyst apps, WhatsApp for Mac isn’t a good Mac app. It doesn’t support the Services menu at all. It doesn’t let you open chats into standalone windows, or open more than one chat window. It opens its Settings right in its one main window. The whole “there’s only one window, and everything is in that one window” design is very iOS. The menu bar is a HIG prescriptivist’s nightmare. All the multi-word menu commands are in <em>Sentence case</em> rather than <em>Title Case</em> (except, of course, for the menu commands that come “free” with Catalyst — how do the developers of the app not notice this?), and the menu title order goes: File, Chat, Edit, Call, View, Window, Help (obviously <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/the-menu-bar">it should be</a> File, Edit, View, Chat, Call, Window, Help). Has there ever once, in 41 years, been a good Mac app that puts a menu between “File” and “Edit”?</p>

<p>But, still, WhatsApp for Mac is a better Mac app <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/12/electron_and_the_decline_of_native_apps">than any Electron app I’ve ever used</a>. Examining it now, it seems lightweight on both CPU usage and memory. It feels a bit better to me than either Signal or Beeper, both of which are developed using Electron, and both of which consume more RAM than WhatsApp. To name just one obvious nicety: when you send a new message in an older chat in WhatsApp, that chat <em>animates</em> as it moves to the top of the list of chats. It slides up, and other chats slide down as they re-sort. In the Signal and Beeper apps for Mac, an updated chat just zaps to the top of the chat list, with no animation at all. Gross.</p>

<p>The question is, did Meta scrap its native Windows app because they don’t care that much about Windows in particular? Or because they don’t care that much about native desktop apps, period — and a crude web app wrapper is coming to Mac next? WhatsApp for Mac is currently the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/mac/charts/36?chart=top-free">top-ranked free app in the Mac App Store</a> — but it’s also <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/collections/computed/apps/TopTrending?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US">the top-ranked free Windows app in the Microsoft Store</a>. Meta did just ship a native Apple Watch app for WhatsApp, but if you want an app for WatchOS, it has to be native. You can’t ship a web app wrapper like an Electron app there.</p>

<p>Personally, I won’t care too much if Meta shitcans the WhatsApp Mac app, because I barely use WhatsApp. But outside America, WhatsApp is the dominant messaging platform in much (most?) of the world. I’d be worried  if I were a Mac user who uses WhatsApp heavily.</p>

	<summary type="text">With the other personalities, you’re choosing between flavors of bullshit. With Efficient, you’re choosing no bullshit.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>OpenAI today, “<a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1/">GPT-5.1: A Smarter, More Conversational ChatGPT</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GPT‑5.1 Instant, ChatGPT’s most used model, is now <em>warmer by
default and more conversational</em>. Based on early testing, it
often surprises people with its playfulness while remaining clear
and useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These changes seem to be in direct response to the ChatGPT users who convinced themselves they had developed personal friendships with the 4o and 4.5 models, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/openai_chatgpt_models_emotional_attachment">who were <em>very</em> upset with the technically superior</a> but less emotionally engaging 5.0 models.</p>

<p>Here are OpenAI’s example responses, quoted in their announcement, to the prompt “I’m feeling stressed and could use some relaxation tips.” (I’m quoting only the first few paragraphs of the responses, which are enough to note the tone.)</p>

<p>GPT-5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here are a few simple, effective ways to help ease stress — you
can mix and match depending on how you’re feeling and how much
time you have:</p>

<p><b>🧘‍♀️️ Quick Reset (1–5 minutes)</b></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Deep breathing:</b> Try the <em>4-7-8</em> method — inhale for 4
seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Repeat 4 rounds.</li>
<li><b>Progressive relaxation:</b> Starting at your toes, tense and
release each muscle group up to your head.</li>
<li><b>Grounding:</b> Look around and name 5 things you see, 4 things
you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. Brings you
into the moment fast.</li>
</ul>

<p>[<em>192 additional words and 3 section-heading emoji omitted.</em>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GPT-5.1 Instant: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve got you, Ron — that’s totally normal, especially with
everything you’ve got going on lately. Here are a few ways to
decompress depending on what kind of stress you’re feeling:</p>

<p><b>🌬️ If your mind feels scattered</b></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Box breathing:</b> Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for
4, hold for 4 — repeat 5 times. It’s fast-acting and physically
calms your nervous system.</li>
<li><b>Name what you see:</b> Pick out 5 things you can see, 4 you can
touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste — a
grounding technique that brings you back to the present.</li>
</ul>

<p>[<em>146 additional words and 2 section-heading emoji omitted.</em>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find the new default response from 5.1 to be a glaring regression. I loathe the shit like “I’ve got you” and “especially with everything you’ve got going on lately”. ChatGPT has no fucking idea what I’ve got going on lately. This is all phony bullshit, and if you have even a thimbleful of understanding of how LLMs work, you <em>know</em> it’s phony. But apparently this phoniness is like emotional crack cocaine to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/756980/openai-chatgpt-users-mourn-gpt-5-4o">some</a>.<sup id="fnr1-2025-11-12"><a href="#fn1-2025-11-12">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But, not to fear. The best feature OpenAI has added to ChatGPT this year is a setting for “Personality” (Settings → Personalization → ChatGPT Personality). OpenAI has expanded the Personality settings with 5.1:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People have strong and varied preferences in how ChatGPT should
respond, and tailoring its tone to what sounds right for you
should feel effortless.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, we added preset options to tailor the tone of
how ChatGPT responds. Today, we’re refining those options to
better reflect the most common ways people use ChatGPT.
<em>Default</em>, <em>Friendly</em> (formerly Listener), and <em>Efficient</em>
(formerly Robot) remain (with updates), and we’re adding
<em>Professional</em>, <em>Candid</em>, and <em>Quirky</em>. These options are
designed to align with what we’ve learned about how people
naturally steer the model, making it quick and intuitive to
choose a personality that feels uniquely right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Robot was the personality that changed how I felt about ChatGPT. Before, I found ChatGPT useful but frequently annoying; after, I’ve found it purely useful.<sup id="fnr2-2025-11-12"><a href="#fn2-2025-11-12">2</a></sup> I was worried when I poked around the updated 5.1 Settings window and saw that Robot was gone, but as their blog post explains, they simply renamed it to Efficient. I think Robot was a better name for this personality. Shouldn’t they all be efficient? Who wants a ChatGPT personality that is inefficient? The most apt description of this personality would be “Unemotional”. If OpenAI doesn’t want to call it that, “Robot” came closer (and made the lack of diabetes-inducing phony sugariness sound fun — who doesn’t like robots?) than “Efficient” does. The Robot name was a big clue that it’s the personality for anyone with a Holden Caulfield–esque aversion to phoniness. “Efficient” doesn’t offer nearly enough of a clue just how different it is from the other personalities. With the other personalities, you’re choosing between flavors of bullshit. With Efficient, you’re choosing no bullshit.</p>

<p>Returning to OpenAI’s own example that they used to demonstrate the difference between the <em>default</em> personalities of the 5.0 and 5.1 models, here is how the Efficient personality responded to me, given the same “I’m feeling stressed and could use some relaxation tips” prompt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quick, simple ways to reduce stress:</p>

<p><b>1. Slow your breathing</b> <br />
Inhale for 4 seconds, hold 2, exhale for 6. Repeat for 1–2
minutes. This reliably lowers heart rate.</p>

<p><b>2. Drop your shoulders</b> <br />
Most people tense here without noticing. Actively relax shoulders,
jaw, and tongue.</p>

<p><b>3. Change your setting for 2 minutes</b> <br />
Stand up, look out a window, or step outside briefly. Even a tiny
environmental shift helps.</p>

<p>[<em>90 additional words, encompassing 4 more suggestions, with
zero emoji, omitted.</em>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The difference is exemplified by the opening lines of the responses, which I’ll repeat here together, for ease of comparison:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>GPT-5.0 Default: <em>Here are a few simple, effective ways to help ease stress — you can mix and match depending on how you’re feeling and how much time you have:</em></p></li>
<li><p>GPT-5.1 Default: <em>I’ve got you, Ron — that’s totally normal, especially with everything you’ve got going on lately. Here are a few ways to decompress depending on what kind of stress you’re feeling:</em></p></li>
<li><p>GPT-5.1 Efficient: <em>Quick, simple ways to reduce stress:</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, do not get your hopes up for the “Cynical” personality, which ChatGPT describes as “cynical and sarcastic”. Its response starts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stress is one of those universal “congratulations, you’re human”
problems, and I’m not thrilled you’re dealing with it. Still, here
I am, begrudgingly trying to help because someone has to care

<p>I’m not sure how to describe that flavor (<em>catheter-like</em>?), but it’s neither cynical nor sarcastic. (To its credit, though, like Efficient, the Cynical response contains no infantilizing emoji.)</p>

<p>I suspect there’s an argument to be made here that OpenAI realizes that this emotional phoniness is addictive and dangerous to some emotionally damaged and (let’s face it) low-intelligence users, and that’s why they originally dialed it back with ChatGPT 5.0. That the overly sentimental, faux-cheerful default character of earlier models was, to OpenAI’s mind, a bug not a feature. But some users saw it the other way around, and now OpenAI is bending to user demand, giving them what they want, not what’s best for their needs. This “pretend friend” personality stuff is emotional junk food with no nutritional value, and <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/chatgpt-dependence-addiction">can lead to obsessive use that isolates users from real human interaction</a> with sustaining emotional value.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-11-12"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<p>I previously used custom instructions for ChatGPT to try to create the sort of no-bullshit personality I wanted. “Use a neutral tone. Don’t pretend to have emotions or a personality. Don’t pretend to be my friend. Mimic the no-nonsense personality of HAL-9000 from <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>.” Stuff like that. Before the availability of the Robot personality (now called Efficient), these instructions helped, but only a little. After I started using the Robot personality, I wound up deleting all of these custom instructions, because they were actually having the reverse effect, leading even the Robot personality to occasionally pad responses with needless phrases like “Here are the facts, plain and simple, without any sentimentality, just like you want them...”. If you’re looking for a similar affect from ChatGPT, try the Efficient (née Robot) personality without any additional instructions — especially instructions you might have added before the Personality setting was available.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2025-11-12"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<p>I upgrade my iPhones and iPads to new iOS releases, including developer betas, pretty much willy-nilly. I’m more conservative about the Macs I use for work. For example, I rely on audio software from <a href="https://www.rogueamoeba.com/">Rogue Amoeba</a> for recording both The Talk Show and Dithering, and <a href="https://www.rogueamoeba.com/support/knowledgebase/?showArticle=Troubleshooting-MacOS-26-Tahoe">there were bugs in MacOS 26.0.0 and 26.0.1</a> that could have resulted in lost audio. Those bugs have been fixed as of MacOS 26.1, so, over the weekend, I upgraded the Mac I use for podcasting. But my main MacBook Pro is still running MacOS 15 Sequoia — not because of any compatibility issues, but simply because I think the Tahoe user interface is goofy looking. I’ll probably bite the bullet and upgrade when 26.2 comes out next month, but for now, I’m luxuriating with a MacOS UI with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/07/tahoes-terrible-icons">well-crafted app icons</a> and windows that don’t have <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/10/16/tahoe-window-corners/">Fisher-Price-style corner radiuses</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, though, I’m keeping MacOS 15 Sequoia up to date. When the MacOS 15.7.2 update arrived last week, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/115499153276833424">I noted in a post on Mastodon</a> that it sure looked like clicking the “Update Now” button next to the MacOS 15.7.2 update in System Settings → General → Software Update would actually install the upgrade to MacOS 26.1 Tahoe. There are little “ⓘ” buttons next to the “Upgrade” buttons for Tahoe 26.1 and “Update” buttons for Sequoia 15.7.2. The “Info” panel that’s presented after clicking <em>either</em> “ⓘ” button shows that Tahoe 26.1 is the version that is checked.</p>

    alt = "Screenshot of MacOS 15.7.1 System Settings: General: Software Update, with an arrow pointing to the ⓘ info button."
    width = 500
  /></a></p>

<p>Click that “ⓘ” button in the “Other Updates” section and you get:</p>

    alt = "Screenshot after clicking the ⓘ button, showing that the upgrade to Tahoe 26.1 is selected, not the available update to Sequoia 15.7.2."

  /></a></p>

<p>Leon Cowle was brave enough to try this out, and, <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@leoncowle/115499194488171450">it turns out</a>, just clicking the “Update Now” button next to Sequoia will, thankfully, do the right thing: install the Sequoia 15.7.2 update, not Tahoe. (I followed Cowle’s brave lead and tried it myself, and can confirm that “Update Now” installed the Sequoia 15.7.2 update.) Why the Info panel presented by clicking the “ⓘ” button <em>next to Sequoia</em> in the “Other Updates” section defaults to installing the upgrade to 26.1 Tahoe, I don’t know. But it sure makes it seem like we need to be more careful than we actually do if we want to stick with MacOS 15 Sequoia for now.</p>

<p>The “ⓘ” buttons do not, as I would expect, open a sheet with detailed information about the software updates <em>per</em> each section of the Software Update settings panel. Instead, even though there are separate “ⓘ”  buttons in each section of the settings panel, they each open the same sheet that allows exact control over which available software updates to install. That includes the exact same <em>default</em> selections in this sheet. But the items selected (checked) in this sheet have <em>no bearing</em> on what gets installed by the “Upgrade Now” and “Update Now” / ”Update Tonight” buttons in the main Software Update settings panel. Those checked items in the “ⓘ” sheet only control what gets installed from within that sheet itself. So if you click the “ⓘ” in the “Other Updates” section, because you want to update to the latest version of MacOS 15 Sequoia and see what other updates are being installed (like Safari, in my example screenshot above), and you don’t pay attention to the checked version of MacOS in that sheet, you can inadvertently upgrade to Tahoe.</p>

<p>I don’t know what the <em>i</em> in the “ⓘ” button is supposed to stand for, but it isn’t <em>intuitive</em>.</p>

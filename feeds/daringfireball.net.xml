<p>CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple chip leader Johny Srouji addressed rumors of his impending
exit in a memo to staff on Monday, saying he doesn’t plan on
leaving the company anytime soon. “I love my team, and I love my
job at Apple, and I don’t plan on leaving anytime soon,” he wrote.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-06/apple-rocked-by-executive-departures-with-johny-srouji-at-risk-of-leaving-next">Bloomberg reported</a> on Saturday that Srouji had told CEO Tim
Cook that he was considering leaving, citing people with knowledge
of the matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn’t <em>rumors</em>, plural. It was one report, on Saturday, from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, and Srouji just called bullshit on it.</p>

<p>What a colossal fuck-up for Gurman and Bloomberg. There’s no possible scenario where Srouji was threatening to leave Apple for a competitor on Saturday and telling his staff (in a memo meant to leak to the press) “I love my job at Apple, and I don’t plan on leaving anytime soon” Monday morning.</p>

<p>The most gracious interpretation for Gurman and Bloomberg is that Srouji <em>had</em> expressed this to Cook, at some point in the recent past, and Cook addressed whatever it took to keep Srouji on board. But even in that scenario, they ran a story Saturday that was wrong at the time it was published.</p>

<p>The more likely scenario is <a href="https://x.com/neilcybart/status/1998143342786515351">the one suggested by Neil Cybart</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If someone wanted to sow seeds of doubt among Apple employees in
an effort to help their own poaching efforts, there are at least
three publications who would have no problem offering an anonymous
microphone to that person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I.e., the source for this story about Srouji being unhappy at Apple and considering leaving for a competitor was aligned with one of those competitors, and Gurman and his editors Bloomberg said “Sure, we’ll print that.” Meta, of course, is the competitor that comes to mind.</p>

<p>It speaks to Gurman’s personal and Bloomberg’s institutional influence that Srouji and Apple saw the need to shoot the bogus narrative down in public like this. I can’t remember the last time an Apple executive saw the need to send an intended-to-leak memo like this to shoot down one bogus story. After <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/05/apple-announces-a-few-other-executive-transitions">last week</a>, though, this one couldn’t be ignored.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Juli Clover, writing at MacRumors (via a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/eu-court-rules-dutch-courts-can-handle-anti-trust-case-against-apples-app-store-2025-12-02/">report at Reuters</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple could ultimately have to pay up to an estimated 637 million
euros to address the damage suffered by 14 million iPhone and iPad
users in the Netherlands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s about €45/user.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lawsuit dates back to 2022, when two Dutch consumer
foundations (Right to Consumer Justice and App Store Claims)
accused Apple of abusing its dominant market position and charging
developers excessive fees. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of
Dutch iPhone and iPad users, and it claimed that Apple’s 30
percent commission inflated prices for apps and in-app purchases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m curious what these consumer foundations would consider a “fair” (and thus legal) commission rate.</p>

<p>This all comes back to the argument that Apple’s App Store commission inflates prices. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/files/DMA-Study-Nov-2025.pdf">A recent Apple-funded (and Apple-promoted) study</a> suggests this is not true — that with lower commissions mandated by the DMA, prices paid by consumers stayed the same and the difference went to the developers. That’s <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-dma-commission-study/">good if you’re a developer</a>, but it’s not the argument being made by these consumer advocate groups.</p>

<p>That said, <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-dma-commission-study/">I pointed out just the other day</a> that Tiimo, a to-do app that Apple just named as the iPhone app of the year in the 2025 App Awards, charges about 20 percent less for subscriptions on its website compared to its in-app subscriptions. An Apple-funded, Apple-promoted study showing that the App Store’s commissions don’t raise prices ought to be taken with a few grains of salt.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple argued that the Dutch court did not have jurisdiction to
hear the case because the EU App Store is run from Ireland, and
therefore the claims should be litigated in Ireland. Apple said
that if the Dutch court was able to hear the case, it could lead
to fragmentation with multiple similar cases across the EU, plus
it argued that customers in the Netherlands could have downloaded
apps while in other EU member states.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know Apple wants this litigated in Ireland because the Irish government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%27s_EU_tax_dispute">sees Apple as an ally, not an adversary</a>, but it does seem contrary to the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_single_market">a single market</a> if a company doing business in the EU is subject to different antitrust laws from each of the EU’s 27 member states.</p>

<p>Dasha Litvinova, reporting for the AP:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Russian authorities said Thursday they have imposed restrictions
on Apple’s video calling service FaceTime, the latest step in an
effort to tighten control over the internet and communications
online. State internet regulator Roskomnadzor alleged in a
statement that the service is being “used to organize and conduct
terrorist activities on the territory of the country, to recruit
perpetrators (and) commit fraud and other crimes against our
citizens.” Apple did not respond to an emailed request for
comment.</p>

<p>The Russian regulator also announced that it has blocked Snapchat,
a messaging app for sharing photos, videos and text messages,
citing the same grounds it gave for restricting FaceTime. It said
that it took the action Oct. 10 even though it only reported the
move on Thursday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m sure the crime rate in Russia will soon plummet. (I’m curious why iMessage isn’t blocked too.)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A DF reader in Russia, who has sent me feedback before, told me that iMessage still works (and in fact told me via iMessage), but that it likely hasn’t been blocked because it isn’t widely used there. (He said that his chat with me is his one and only iMessage thread.) FaceTime, on the other hand, is quite popular in Russia. Or at least it was.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mike Isaac, reporting for The New York Times, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/technology/meta-cuts-metaverse-unit.html?unlocked_article_code=1.608.XuJW.cN8SImoOdegY">Meta Weighs Cuts to Its Metaverse Unit</a>” (gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meta is considering making cuts to a division in its Reality Labs
unit that works on the so-called metaverse, said three employees
with knowledge of the matter.</p>

<p>The cuts could come as soon as next month and amount to 10 to 30
percent of employees in the Metaverse unit, which works on virtual
reality headsets and a V.R.-based social network, the people said.
The numbers of potential layoffs are still in flux, they said.
Other parts of the Reality Labs division develop smart glasses,
wristbands and other wearable devices. The total number of
employees in Reality Labs could not be learned.</p>

<p>Meta does not plan to abandon building the metaverse, the people
said. Instead, executives expect to shift the savings from the
cuts into investments in its augmented reality glasses, the
people said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meta confirmed the cuts <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-plans-to-shift-spending-away-from-the-metaverse-d0ac3b7f">to the Wall Street Journal</a>, and <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/251204/p27#a251204p27">Blooomberg’s Kurt Wagner broke the news Thursday</a>.</p>

<p>I’m so old that I remember ... checks notes ... four years ago, when Facebook renamed itself Meta in late 2021 with <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">this statement</a>: “Meta’s focus will be to bring the metaverse to life and help people connect, find communities and grow businesses.” And <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/">Mark Zuckerberg, announcing the change, wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But all of our products, including our apps, now share a new
vision: to help bring the metaverse to life. And now we have a
name that reflects the breadth of what we do.</p>

<p>From now on, we will be metaverse-first, not Facebook-first. That
means that over time you won’t need a Facebook account to use our
other services. As our new brand starts showing up in our
products, I hope people around the world come to know the Meta
brand and the future we stand for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many of us never fell for this metaverse nonsense. For example, I’m also old enough to remember just one year later, near the end of Joanna Stern’s on-stage interview with Craig Federighi and Greg Joswiak at a 2022 WSJ event, seven months before Vision Pro was announced (<a href="https://youtu.be/m-ugwoEOMvg?t=1770">at the 29:30 mark</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Stern:</strong> You have to finish this sentence, both of you. The
metaverse is...</p>

<p><strong>Joz:</strong> A word I’ll never use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He might want to use the word now, just to make jokes.</p>

<p>Om Malik, <a href="https://blog.om.co/2025/04/28/no-gruber-this-is-why-facebook-renamed-itself/">writing in April this year</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of us are old enough to remember that the reason Mark renamed
the company is because the Facebook brand was becoming toxic, and
associated with misinformation and global-scale crap. It was
viewed as a tired, last-generation company. Meta allowed the
company to rebrand itself <a href="https://om.co/2021/10/31/facebook-is-now-meta/">as something amazing and fresh</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lastly, yours truly, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/28/om-malik-facebook-rename">linking to Malik’s post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And so while “Meta” will never be remembered as the company that
spearheaded the metaverse — because the metaverse never was or
will be an actual thing — it’s in truth the perfect name for a
company that believes in nothing other than its own success.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One small update I just appended to my piece Friday taking a look at the winning apps from this year’s App Store Awards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lastly, I have questions — some really hard questions — regarding <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/tiimo-icon.png">Tiimo’s app icon</a>. Such as, “What is that?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it got picked because it makes <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/07/tahoes-terrible-icons">Apple’s new OS 26 icons</a> look good by comparison?</p>

It’s a $7/month or $70/year subscription, and included in the Stratechery Plus bundle (a bargain). This year our CMS (<a href="https://passport.online/">Passport</a> — check it out) gained a feature that lets us make some episodes free for everyone to listen to on the website. Today’s episode, regarding Alan Dye leaving Apple for Meta, seems like a good one to do that with. (And, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/16/dithering-being-real-points">once again</a>, this month’s album art serendipitously captures my mood.)</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Aaron Tilley and Wayne Ma, in a piece headlined “Why Silicon Valley is Buzzing About Apple CEO Succession” at the paywalled-up-the-wazoo The Information:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prediction site Polymarket <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/next-ceo-of-apple">places Ternus’ odds of getting the
job</a> at nearly 55%, ahead of other current Apple executives
such as software head Craig Federighi, Chief Operating Officer
Sabih Khan and marketing head Greg Joswiak. But some people close
to Apple don’t believe Ternus is ready to take on such a
high-profile role, and that could make a succession announcement
unlikely anytime soon, said people familiar with the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing in the rest of the article backs up that “some people close
to Apple don’t believe Ternus is ready” claim, other than this, several paragraphs later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And while his fans believe Ternus has the temperament to be CEO,
many of them say he isn’t a charismatic leader in the mold of a
Jobs. He has also had little involvement in the geopolitical and
government affairs issues that dominate most of Cook’s time these
days. On a recent trip to China, for example, Apple’s new COO,
Sabih Khan, accompanied Cook to some of his meetings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one else in the history of the industry, let alone the company, has the charisma of Steve Jobs. And while I think Polymarket has the shortlist of candidates right, I also think they have them listed in the right order. Sabih Khan probably should be considered an outside-chance maybe, but the fact that he accompanied Cook to China doesn’t make me think, for a second, that it’s in preparation to name him CEO. If Khan were being groomed to become CEO, he’d have started appearing in keynotes already. It’s silly to slag Ternus for not having the charisma of Steve Jobs, when Ternus has been a strong presence in keynotes since 2018, and <em>in the same paragraph</em> suggest Khan as a better option, when Khan has never once appeared in a keynote or public appearance representing Apple.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some former Apple executives hope a dark-horse candidate emerges.
For example, Tony Fadell, a former Apple hardware executive who
coinvented [<em>sic</em>] the iPod, has told associates recently that he
would be open to replacing Cook as CEO, according to people who
have heard his remarks. (Other people close to Apple consider
Fadell an unlikely candidate, in part because he was a polarizing
figure when he worked at the company. Fadell left Apple in 2010.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The parenthetical undersells the unlikelihood of Fadell returning to Apple, ever, in any role, let alone the borderline insanity of suggesting he’d come back as Cook’s successor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has become one of the strangest succession spectacles in tech.
Typically, the kind of buzz that is swirling around Cook occurs
when companies are performing badly or a CEO has dropped hints
that they’re getting ready to hang up their spurs. Neither applies
in Cook’s case, though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s nothing strange about it. Apple has a unique company culture, but so too do its peers, like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. And just like at those companies, it’s therefore a certainty that Cook’s replacement will come from within the company’s current ranks. Polymarket doesn’t even list anyone other than Ternus, Federighi, Joswiak, and Khan.</p>

<p>As for hints, there is not much need for any hint beyond the fact that Cook is now 65 years old and has been in the job since 2011. But the high-profile multi-source <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/15/ft-apple-tim-cook-succession">leak to the Financial Times</a> is a pretty obvious fucking additional hint.</p>

<p>Apple Newsroom, yesterday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced that Jennifer Newstead will become Apple’s
general counsel on March 1, 2026, following a transition of duties
from Kate Adams, who has served as Apple’s general counsel since
2017. She will join Apple as senior vice president in January,
reporting to CEO Tim Cook and serving on Apple’s executive team.</p>

<p>In addition, Lisa Jackson, vice president for Environment, Policy,
and Social Initiatives, will retire in late January 2026. The
Government Affairs organization will transition to Adams, who will
oversee the team until her retirement late next year, after which
it will be led by Newstead. Newstead’s title will become senior
vice president, General Counsel and Government Affairs, reflecting
the combining of the two organizations. The Environment and Social
Initiatives teams will report to Apple chief operating officer
Sabih Khan. [...]</p>

<p>Newstead was most recently chief legal officer at Meta and
previously served as the legal adviser of the U.S. Department of
State, where she led the legal team responsible for advising the
Secretary of State on legal issues affecting the conduct of U.S.
foreign relations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Monday’s announcement <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/01/giannandrea-out">that AI head John Giannandrea is retiring</a> and the hierarchy for AI related projects being further reshuffled under software head Craig Federighi was significant, but not surprising, given <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">how things went this year</a> for Apple with AI.</p>

<p>Wednesday’s announcement that VP of design and Liquid Glass frontman Alan Dye is leaving Apple for Meta was a shock, both inside and outside the company. As I wrote this week, I think <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/12/bad_dye_job">it’s great news for Apple</a>, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/12/dye_cook_blind_spot">not by plan</a>.</p>

<p>This news yesterday is just typical planned retirements. The timing is slightly unfortunate though. In the eyes of observers unfamiliar with the company, they might be misconstrued as signs of executive upheaval, occurring on the heels of the minor and major dramas of Giannandrea’s and Dye’s departures. The Jackson / Adams / Newstead transitions announced yesterday are nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>Jackson had a very nice run at Apple and carved out a rather unique position within the company. Apple’s environmental efforts expanded tremendously under her leadership. I’ve never met anyone with a bad word to say about her, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2017/04/21/ep-188">in my own interactions</a>, found her downright delightful.</p>

<p>As for Adams, the responsibilities of Apple’s general counsel are generally far afield from my interests. The only two times I’ve mentioned her at DF were <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/10/06/sewell-adams">when she got the job in 2017</a>, and a passing reference when the FBI sent <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/01/08/fbi-apple-pensacola-shooter">a letter to Apple, addressed to Adams, in 2020</a> regarding the locked phone of a mass shooter in Pensacola, Florida. That’s a sign of a good run for a general counsel — it’s a job where no news is good news.</p>

<p>Lastly, I wouldn’t read anything into Newstead coming to Apple by way of Meta. But it is a bit funny that it was announced the day after Dye left Apple <em>for</em> Meta. She seems to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Gillian_Newstead">an excellent wide-ranging background</a> to spearhead Apple’s government affairs. Her stint in the State Department was during the first (now seemingly sane) Trump administration, but she clerked for liberal Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.</p>

<p>Apple, today: “<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1849728503">Announcing the 2025 App Store Awards</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This year’s winners represent the best-in-class apps and games
we returned to again and again. We hope you enjoy them as much
as we do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did not enjoy all of them as much as Apple did.</p>

<h2>Tiimo</h2>

<p>iPhone app of the year <a href="https://www.tiimoapp.com/">Tiimo</a> bills itself as an “AI Planner &amp; To-do” app that is designed with accommodations for people with ADHD and other neurodivergences. Subscription plans cost $12/month ($144/year) or $54/year ($4.50/month). It does not offer a native Mac app, and at the end of onboarding/account setup, it suggests <a href="https://webapp.tiimoapp.com/home">their web app</a> for use on desktop computers. When I went to the web app, after signing in with the “Sign in With Apple” account I created on the iPhone app, Tiimo prompted me to sign up for an annual subscription for $42/year ($3.50/month), or monthly for $10 ($120/year). The in-app subscriptions offer a 30-day free trial; the less expensive pay-on-the-web subscriptions only offer a 7-day free trial. The web app doesn’t let you do anything without a paid account (or at least starting a trial); the iOS app offers quite a bit of basic functionality free of charge.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1847760015">From Apple’s own description for why it gave Tiimo the award</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Built to support people who are neurodivergent (and anyone
distracted by the hum of modern life), Tiimo brought clarity to our
busy schedules using color-coded, emoji-accented blocks. The
calming visual approach made even the most hectic days feel
manageable.</p>

<p>It starts by syncing everything in Calendar and Reminders, pulling
in doctor’s appointments, team meetings, and crucial prompts to
walk the dog or stand up and stretch. Instead of dumping it all
into a jumbled list, the app gives each item meaning by
automatically assigning it a color and an emoji. (Tiimo gave us the
option to change the weightlifter emoji it added to our workout
reminders, but its pick was spot on.)</p>

<p>While on the move with coffee in one hand and keys in the other,
we sometimes talked to Tiimo with the Al chatbot feature to add new
tasks or shift appointments. When we felt overwhelmed by our to-do
list, Tiimo kept us laser-focused by bubbling up just high-priority
tasks, while its built-in Focus timer (accessible from any to-do
with a tap) saved us from the pitfalls of multitasking.</p>

<p>But Tiimo really stood out when we faced a big personal project,
like getting our Halloween decorations up before Thanksgiving.
With the help of Al, the app suggested all the smaller tasks
that would get us there: gathering the decorations from the
garage, planning the layout, securing the cobwebs, and doing a
safety check.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from the web app, <a href="https://www.tiimoapp.com/faq">Tiimo is iOS exclusive</a>, with apps only for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. No Android version. It seems to do a good job with native platform integration (Calendar integration is free; Reminders integration requires a subscription). Animations in the app feel slow to me, which makes the app itself feel slow. And, personally, I find Tiimo’s emphasis on decorating everything with emoji <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/11/chatgpt_5-1_with_renamed_and_new_personalities">distracting and childish</a>, not clarifying.</p>

<p>The app seems OK, but not award-worthy to me. But, admittedly, I’m not in the target audience for Tiimo’s ADHD/neurodivergent focus. I don’t need reminders to have coffee in the morning, start work, have dinner, or to watch TV at night, which are all things Tiimo prefilled on my Today schedule after I went through onboarding. As I write this sentence, I’ve been using Tiimo for five minutes, and it’s already prompted me twice to rate it on the App Store. Nope, wait, I just got a third prompt. That’s thirsty, and a little gross. (And, although I’m not an ADHD expert, three prompts to rate and review the app in the first 10 minutes of use strikes me as contrary to the needs of the easily distracted.)</p>

<p>Lastly, I have questions — some really hard questions — regarding <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/tiimo-icon.png">Tiimo’s app icon</a>. Such as, “What is that?”</p>

<h2>Essayist</h2>

<p>Mac app of the year <a href="https://www.essayist.app/">Essayist</a> bills itself as “The Word Processor designed for Academic Writing” (capitalization verbatim). Subscriptions cost $80/year ($6.67/month) or $10/month ($120/year). Its <em>raison d’être</em> is managing citations and references, and automatically formatting the entire document, including citations, according to a variety of standards (MLA, Chicago, etc.). Quoting from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1848945161">Apple’s own description of Essayist</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Essayist gives you an easy way to organize a dizzying array of
primary sources. Ebooks, podcasts, presentations, and even direct
messages and emails can be cataloged with academic rigor. Using
macOS Foundation Models, Essayist extracts all the key info needed
to use it as a source.</p>

<p>For example, paste a YouTube URL into an entry and Essayist
automatically fills in the name of the video, its publication
date, and the date you accessed it. Drag in an article as a PDF to
have Essayist fill in the title, author, and more — and store the
PDF for easy access. You can also search for the books and journal
articles you’re citing right in the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essayist is a document-based (as opposed to library-based) app, and its custom file format is a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/AboutBundles/AboutBundles.html">package</a> with the adorable file extension “.essay”. The default font for documents is Times New Roman, and the only other option is, of all fonts, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/arial">Arial</a> — and you need an active subscription to switch the font to Arial. (<em>Paying money for the privilege to use Arial... Jiminy fucking christ. I might need a drink.</em>) I appreciate the simplicity of severely limiting font choices to focus the user’s attention on the writing, but offering Times New Roman and Arial as the only options means you’re left with the choice between “the default font’s default font” and “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/10/02/when-the-clients-specs-arial">font crime</a>”. The Essayist app itself <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/essayist-app-menu.png">has no Settings</a>; instead, it offers only <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/essayist-document-window-menu.png">per-document settings</a>.</p>

<p>The app carries a few whiffs of non-Mac-likeness (e.g. the aforementioned lack of Settings, and some <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/essayist-alerts.png">lame-looking custom alerts</a>). The document settings window refers to a new document, even after it has been saved with a name, as “Untitled” until you close and reopen the document. Reopened documents do not remember their window size and position. But <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32113754">poking around with <code>otool</code></a>, it appears to be written using AppKit, not Catalyst. I suspected the app might be Catalyst because there are companion iOS apps for iPhone and iPad, which seem to offer identical feature sets as the Mac app. Essayist uses a clever system where, unless you have a subscription, documents can <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/essayist-unlock-access.png">only be edited on the device on which they were created</a>, but you can open them read-only on other devices. That feels like a good way to encourage paying while giving you a generous way to evaluate Essayist free of charge. There is no Android, Windows, or web app version — it’s exclusive to Mac and iOS.</p>

<p>I’ve never needed to worry about adhering to a specific format for academic papers, and that’s the one and only reason I can see to use Essayist. In all other aspects, it seems a serviceable but very basic, almost primitive, word processor. <s>There’s no support for embedding images or figures of any kind in a document, for example.</s> [Correction: <a href="https://www.essayist.app/guides/figures---tables">Essayist does support figures</a>, but I missed the UI for how to insert them.]</p>

<h2>Detail</h2>

<p>iPad app of the year <a href="https://detail.co/">Detail</a> bills itself, simply and to the point, as an “AI Video Editor”. The default subscription is $70/year ($5.83/month) with a 3-day free trial; the other option is to pay $12/month ($144/year) with no free trial. After a quick test drive, Detail seems like an excellent video editing app, optimized for creating formats common on social media, like reel-style vertical videos where you, the creator, appear as a cutout in the corner, in front of the video or images that you’re talking about. The iPhone version seems equally good. The iPad version of Detail will install and run on MacOS, but it’s one of those “Designed for iPad / Not verified for macOS” direct conversions. But they do offer a standalone Mac app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/detail-video-studio/id6443923358">Detail Studio</a>, which is a real Mac app, written using AppKit, which requires a separate subscription to unlock pro features ($150/year or $22/month). Detail only offers apps for iOS and MacOS — no  Windows, Android, or web.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/ipad/story/id1847760011">From Apple’s own acclaim for Detail</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we used Detail to record a conversation of two people sitting
side by side, the app automatically created a cut that looked like
it was captured with two cameras. It zoomed in on one speaker,
then cut away to the other person’s reaction. The app also made it
easy to unleash our inner influencer. We typed a few key points,
and the app’s AI wrote a playful script that it loaded into its
teleprompter so we could read straight to the camera.</p>

<p>Most importantly, Detail helped us memorialize significant life
moments all while staying present. At a birthday party, we propped
an iPad on a table and used Detail to record with the front and
back cameras simultaneously. The result was a split-screen video
with everyone singing “Happy Birthday” on the left and the guest
of honor blowing out the candles on the right. (No designated
cameraperson needed.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Detail has a bunch of seemingly genuinely useful AI-based features. But putting all AI features aside, it feels like a thoughtful, richly featured <em>manual</em> video editor. I suspect that’s why the AI features might work well — they’re an ease-of-use / automation layer atop a professional-quality non-AI foundation. Basically, Detail seems like what Apple’s own Clips — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/13/clips-eol">recently end-of-life’d</a> — should have been. It turns your iPad (or iPhone) into a self-contained video studio. Cool.</p>

<hr />

<p>Of these three apps — Tiimo on iPhone, Essayist on Mac, and Detail on iPad — Detail appeals to me the most, and strikes me as the most deserving of this award. If I were to start making videos for modern social media, I’d strongly evaluate Detail as my primary tool.</p>

<p>Apple still has no standalone category for AI apps, but all three of these apps emphasize AI features, and Apple itself calls out those AI features in its praise for them. It’s an obvious recurring theme shared by all three, along with their shared monetization strategies of being free to download with in-app subscriptions to unlock all features, and the fact that all three winners are exclusive to iOS and Mac (and, in Tiimo’s case, the web).</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Meg James, reporting for The Los Angeles Times (<a href="https://apple.news/Ak1molISkQ4GGq7cNQtPOSw">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The two companies announced the blockbuster deal early Friday
morning. The takeover would give Netflix such beloved characters
as Batman, Harry Potter and Fred Flintstone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fred Flintstone?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Ted
Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said in a statement. “By combining
Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies — from
timeless classics like <em>Casablanca</em> and <em>Citizen Kane</em> to modern
favorites like <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Friends</em> — with our
culture-defining titles like <em>Stranger Things</em>, <em>KPop Demon
Hunters</em> and <em>Squid Game</em>, we’ll be able to do that even better.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure <em>Squid Game</em> belongs in the same comparison as <em>Citizen Kane</em>, but the Warners library is incredibly deep. Stanley Kubrick’s post-<em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> films were all for Warner Bros.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Netflix’s cash and stock transaction is valued at about $27.75 per
Warner Bros. Discovery share. Netflix also agreed to take on more
than $10 billion in Warner Bros. debt, pushing the deal’s value to
$82.7 billion. [...] Warner’s cable channels, including CNN, TNT
and HGTV, are not included in the deal. They will form a new
publicly traded company, Discovery Global, in mid-2026.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know if this deal makes sense for Netflix, but Netflix has earned my trust. Netflix is a product-first company. They care about the quality of their content, their software, their service, and their brand. If you care about the Warner/HBO legacy, an acquisition by Netflix is a much, much better outcome than if David Ellison had bought it to merge with Paramount.</p>

<p>The LA Times article goes on to cite concerns from the movie theater industry, based on Netflix’s historic antipathy toward theatrical releases for its films. Netflix is promising to keep Warner Bros.’s film studio a separate operation, maintaining the studio’s current support for theatrical releases. I hope they do. I grew up loving going to the movies. I still enjoy it, but the truth is I go far less often as the years go on. Movie theaters shouldn’t be a protected class of business just because there’s so much affection and nostalgia for them. If they continue sliding into irrelevance, so be it. That’s how disruption, progress, and competition work.</p>

	<summary type="text">How could someone who would even *consider* leaving Apple for Meta rise to a level of such prominence at Apple, including as one of the few public faces of the company?</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-slams-facebook-privacy-human-right-it-n860816">NBC News, back in March 2018</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Speaking at a town hall event hosted by MSNBC’s Chris Hayes and
Recode’s Kara Swisher, Cook said Facebook put profits above all
else when it allegedly allowed user data to be taken through
connected apps. [...]</p>

<p>When asked what he would do if he were in Zuckerberg’s position,
Cook replied: “What would I do? I wouldn’t be in this situation.”</p>

<p>“The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our
customer, if our customer was our product,” Cook said. “We’ve
elected not to do that.”</p>

<p>“Privacy to us is a human right. It’s a civil liberty, and
something that is unique to America. This is like freedom of
speech and freedom of the press,” Cook said. “Privacy is right up
there with that for us.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps Cook now needs to define “us”.</p>

<p>This was a rather memorable interview. Cook’s “What would I do? I wouldn’t be in this situation” is one of the stone-coldest lines he’s ever zinged at a rival company. (In public, that is.) That was just ice cold. Cook is a consummate diplomat. Most non-founder big company CEOs are. Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Andy Jassy — none of them are known for throwing shade, let alone sharp elbows, at competitors. Cook has made an exception, <a href="https://time.com/5433499/tim-cook-apple-data-privacy/">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/apples-tim-cook-criticizes-social-media-practices-intensifying-facebook-confli-idUSKBN29X2NB/">times</a>, when it comes to Facebook/Meta (and to a lesser degree, Google).</p>

<p>So it’s not just that Alan Dye jumped ship from Apple for the chief designer officer role at another company.<sup id="fnr1-2025-12-04"><a href="#fn1-2025-12-04">1</a></sup> It’s not just that he left for a <em>rival</em> company. It’s that he left Apple for <em>Meta</em>, of all companies. Given what Cook has said about Meta publicly, one can only imagine what he thinks about them privately. Apple executives tend to stay at Apple. The stability of its executive team is unparalleled. But Dye is a senior leader who not only left for a rival, but the one rival that Cook and the rest of Apple’s senior leadership team consider the most antithetical to Apple’s ideals.</p>

<p>It would have been surprising if Dye had jumped ship to Google or Microsoft. It would have been a little more surprising if he’d left for Amazon, if only because Amazon seemingly places no cultural value whatsoever on design, as Apple practices it. But maybe with Amazon it would have been seen as Andy Jassy deciding to get serious about design, and thus, in a way, less surprising after the fact. But leaving Apple for <em>Meta</em>, of all companies, feels shocking. How could someone who would even <em>consider</em> leaving Apple for Meta rise to a level of such prominence at Apple, including as one of the few <a href="https://www.printmag.com/podcasts/2025/design-matters-craig-federighi-and-alan-dye/">public faces of the company</a>?</p>

<p>So it’s not just that Alan Dye is a fraud of a UI designer and leader, and that Apple’s senior leadership had a blind spot to the ways Dye’s leadership was steering Apple’s interface design deeply astray. That’s problem enough, as I emphasized <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/12/bad_dye_job">in my piece yesterday</a>. It’s also that it’s now clear that Dye’s moral compass was not aligned with Apple’s either. Tim Cook and the rest — or at least most? — of Apple’s senior leadership apparently couldn’t see that, either.</p>

<p>I’d have thrown OpenAI in that list of companies where it would have been surprising, but not shocking, for Dye to leave Apple for.

	<summary type="text">It might have made some sense to bring someone from the fashion/brand world to lead software design for Apple Watch, but it sure didn’t seem to make sense for the rest of Apple’s platforms. And the decade of Dye’s HI leadership has proven it.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>In <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/03/alan-dye-leaves-apple-for-meta">my post earlier today</a> on the then-breaking news that Alan Dye has left Apple to join Meta as chief design officer (<a href="https://www.meta.com/media-gallery/executives/">a new title at the company</a><sup id="fnr1-2025-12-03"><a href="#fn1-2025-12-03">1</a></sup>), I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It sounds like Dye chose to jump ship, and wasn’t squeezed out (as
it seems <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/01/giannandrea-out">with former AI chief John Giannandrea</a> earlier this
week). Gurman/Bloomberg are spinning this like a coup for Meta
(headline: “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-03/apple-design-executive-alan-dye-poached-by-meta-in-major-coup">Apple Design Executive Alan Dye Poached by Meta in
Major Coup</a>”), but I think this is the best personnel news at Apple
in decades. Dye’s decade-long stint running Apple’s software
design team has been, on the whole, terrible — and rather than
getting better, the problems have been getting worse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dye’s replacement at Apple is longtime Apple designer Stephen Lemay. I’ve never met Lemay (or at least can’t recall meeting him), and prior to today never heard much about him. But that’s typical for Apple employees. Part of the job working for Apple is remaining under the radar and out of the public eye. What I’ve learned today is that Lemay, very much unlike Dye, is a career interface/interaction designer. Sources I’ve spoken to who’ve worked with Lemay at Apple speak highly of him, particularly his attention to detail and craftsmanship. Those things have been sorely lacking in the Dye era. Not everyone loves everything Lemay has worked on, but nobody bats 1.000 and designers love to critique each other’s work. I’ve chatted with people with criticisms of specific things Lemay has worked on or led at Apple (e.g. aspects of iPadOS multitasking that struck many of us as deliberately limiting, rather than empowering), but <em>everyone</em> I’ve spoken to is happy — if not downright giddy — at the news that Lemay is replacing Dye. Lemay is well-liked personally and deeply respected talent-wise. Said one source, in a position to know the choices, “I don’t think there was a better choice than Lemay.”</p>

<p>The sentiment within the ranks at Apple is that today’s news is almost too good to be true. People had given up hope that Dye would ever get squeezed out, and no one expected that he’d just up and leave on his own. (If you care about design, there’s nowhere to go but down after leaving Apple. What people overlooked is the obvious: Alan Dye doesn’t actually care about design.)</p>

<p>What I struggled with in the wake of today’s news is how to square the following contradiction:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dye apparently left for Meta on his own; he wasn’t squeezed out.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple replacing Dye with Lemay seemingly signals a significant shift in direction, replacing a guy whose approach was almost entirely superficial/visual with a guy who’s spent his entire career sweating actual interaction details.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If Apple’s senior leadership would have been happy to have Dye remain as leader of Apple’s software design teams, why didn’t they replace him with a Dye acolyte? Conversely, if the decision makers at Apple saw the need for a directional change, why wasn’t Dye pushed out?<sup id="fnr2-2025-12-03"><a href="#fn2-2025-12-03">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The answer, I think, is that the decision to elevate Lemay wasn’t about direction, but loyalty. Why risk putting in a Dye-aligned replacement when that person might immediately get poached too? We know, from this year’s AI recruitment battles, that Zuckerberg is willing to throw <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/06/18/metas-100-million-signing-bonuses-openai-staff-extreme-ai-talent-war/">almost unfathomable sums of money</a> to poach talent he wants to hire from competitors. Gurman reported that Billy Sorrentino, a Dye deputy who has served as a senior director of design at Apple since 2016, is leaving for Meta with Dye.<sup id="fnr3-2025-12-03"><a href="#fn3-2025-12-03">3</a></sup> I don’t have any other names, but word on the street is that other members of Dye’s inner circle are leaving Apple for Meta with him. But those who remain — or who might remain, if they’d have been offered the promotion to replace Dye — simply can’t be trusted from the perspective of senior leadership, who were apparently blindsided by Dye’s departure for Meta. They wouldn’t have given Dye a prime spot in the WWDC keynote if they thought he might be leaving within months.</p>

<p>So the change in direction we may see — that many of us desperately <em>hope</em> to see — under Lemay’s leadership might be happenstance. More a factor of Lemay being politically safe, as someone predating Dye and outside Dye’s inner circle at Apple, than from Tim Cook or anyone else in senior leadership seeing a <em>need</em> for a directional change in UI design. But happenstance or not, it could be the best thing to happen to Apple’s HI design in the entire stretch since Steve Jobs’s passing and Scott Forstall’s ouster.</p>

<p>Putting Alan Dye in charge of user interface design was the one big mistake Jony Ive made as Apple’s Chief Design Officer.<sup id="fnr4-2025-12-03"><a href="#fn4-2025-12-03">4</a></sup> Dye had no background in user interface design — he came from a brand and print advertising background. Before joining Apple, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/how-alan-dye-went-from-iphone-box-designer-to-apples-head-of-ui">he was design director for the fashion brand Kate Spade</a>, and before that worked on branding for the ad agency Ogilvy. His promotion to lead Apple’s software interface design team under Ive happened in 2015, when Apple was launching Apple Watch, their closest foray into the world of fashion. It might have made some sense to bring someone from the fashion/brand world to lead software design for Apple Watch, but it sure didn’t seem to make sense for the rest of Apple’s platforms. And the decade of Dye’s HI leadership has proven it.</p>

<p>The most galling moment in Dye’s entire tenure was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3KnMyojEQU">the opening of this year’s iPhone event keynote in September</a>, which began with a title card showing the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/01/23/how-it-works">oft-cited Jobs quote</a> “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” The whole problem with the Dye era of HI design at Apple is that it has so largely — not entirely, but largely — been driven purely by how things look. There are a lot of things in Apple’s software — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/07/tahoes-terrible-icons">like app icons</a> — that don’t even look good any more. But it’s the “how it works” part that has gone so horribly off the rails. Alan Dye seems like <em>exactly</em> the sort of person Jobs was describing in the first part of that quote: “People think it’s this veneer — that the designers are handed this box and told, ‘Make it look good!’”</p>

<p>I am not a Liquid Glass hater. I actually think, on the whole, iOS 26 is a better and more usable UI than iOS 18. But MacOS 26 Tahoe is a mess, visually, and I’m not sure there’s a single thing about its UI that is better than MacOS 15 Sequoia. There are <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/09/macos-26-tahoe-review-power-under-glass/">new software features in Tahoe</a> that are excellent and serve as legitimate enticements to upgrade. But I’m talking about the user interface — the work from Alan Dye’s HI team, not Craig Federighi’s teams. I think the fact that Liquid Glass is worse on MacOS than it is on iOS is not just a factor of iOS being Apple’s most popular, most profitable, most important platform — and thus garnering more of Apple’s internal attention. I think it’s also about the fact that the Mac interface, with multiple windows, bigger displays, and more complexity, demands more nuanced, more expert, interaction design skills. Things like depth, layering, and unambiguous indications of input focus are important aspects of any platform. But they’re more important on the platform which, by design, shoulders more complexity. Back in 2010, predicting a bright future for the Mac at a time when many pundits were thinking Apple would soon put the entire platform out to pasture, I wrote, “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/12/future_of_the_mac_in_an_ios_world">It’s the heaviness of the Mac that allows iOS to remain light</a>.” That remains as true today as it was 15 years ago. But Liquid Glass, especially as expressed on MacOS, is a lightweight poorly considered design system as a whole, and its conceptual thinness is not sufficient to properly allow the Mac to carry the weight it needs to bear.</p>

<p>Perhaps more tellingly, there should have been no need for the “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/21/ios-26-1-beta-4-liquid-glass-tinted-option">clear/tinted</a>” Liquid Glass preference setting that Apple added in the 26.1 OS releases. Alan Dye wasn’t fired, by all accounts, but that preference setting was as good a sign as any that he should have been. And it’s very much a sign that inside Apple, there’s a strong enough contingent of people who prioritize how things work — like, you know, <a href="https://x.com/Namelongnumbers/status/1996303867735375978">whether you can read text against the background of an alert</a> — to get a setting like this shipped, outside the Accessibility section of Settings.</p>

<p>It remains worrisome that Apple needed to luck into Dye leaving the company. But fortune favors the prepared, and Apple remains prepared by having an inordinate number of longtime talented HI designers at the company. The oddest thing about Alan Dye’s stint leading software design is that there are, effectively, zero design critics who’ve been on his side. The debate regarding Apple’s software design over the last decade isn’t between those on Dye’s side and those against. It’s only a matter of debating how bad it’s been, and how far it’s fallen from its previous remarkable heights. It’s rather extraordinary in today’s hyper-partisan world that there’s nearly universal agreement amongst actual practitioners of user-interface design that Alan Dye is a fraud who led the company deeply astray. It was a big problem inside the company too. I’m aware of dozens of designers who’ve left Apple, out of frustration over the company’s direction, to work at places like LoveFrom, OpenAI, and their secretive joint venture <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/21/sam-and-jony-io">io</a>. I’m not sure there are any interaction designers at io who aren’t ex-Apple, and if there are, it’s only a handful. From the stories I’m aware of, the theme is identical: these are designers driven to do great work, and under Alan Dye, “doing great work” was no longer the guiding principle at Apple. If reaching the most users is your goal, go work on design at Google, or Microsoft, or Meta. (Design, of course, isn’t even a thing at Amazon.) Designers choose to work at Apple to do the best work in the industry. That has stopped being true under Alan Dye. The most talented designers I know are the harshest critics of Dye’s body of work, and the direction in which it’s been heading.</p>

<p>Back in June, after WWDC, I quoted from Alan Dye’s introduction of Liquid Glass during the keynote, and then quoted from <a href="https://youtu.be/dHrVGk0WwYM?t=381">Steve Jobs’s introduction of Aqua</a> when he unveiled the Mac OS X Public Beta in January 2000. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/some_brief_thoughts_and_observations_on_wwdc_2025">I wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Re-watching Jobs’s introduction of Aqua for the umpteenth time, I
still find it enthralling. I found Alan Dye’s introduction of
Liquid Glass to be soporific, if not downright horseshitty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the bits from Jobs’s Aqua introduction I quoted was this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is what the top of windows look like. These three buttons
look like a traffic signal, don’t they? Red means close the
window. Yellow means minimize the window. And green means maximize
the window. Pretty simple. And tremendous fit and finish in this
operating system. When you roll over these things, you get those.
You see them? And when you are no longer the key window, they go
transparent. So a lot of fit and finish in this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After I published that post, I got a note from a designer friend who left Apple, in frustration, a few years ago. After watching Jobs’s Aqua introduction for the first time in years, he told me, “I’m really struck by Steve directly speaking to ‘radio buttons’ and ‘the key window’.” He had the feeling that Dye and his team looked down on interface designers who used terms like Jobs himself once used — in a public keynote, no less. That to Dye’s circle, such terms felt too much like “programmer talk”. But the history of Apple (and NeXT) user interface design is the opposite. Designers and programmers used to — and still should — speak the exact same language about such concepts. Steve Jobs certainly did, and something feels profoundly broken about that disconnect under Alan Dye’s leadership. It’s like the head of cinematography for a movie telling the camera team to stop talking about nerdy shit like “f-stops”. The head of cinematography shouldn’t just abide talking about f-stops and focal lengths, but love it. Said my friend to me, regarding his interactions with Dye and his team at Apple, “I swear I had conversations in which I mentioned ‘key window’ and no one knew what I meant.”</p>

<p>That won’t be a problem with Stephen Lemay. Understanding of fundamental principles will no longer be lacking. Lemay has been at Apple spanning the gamut between the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/greg+christie">Greg Christie</a>/<a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/bas+ording">Bas Ording</a> glory days and the current era. At the very least, Lemay running HI should stop the bleeding — both in terms of work quality and talent retention. I sincerely believe things might measurably improve, but I’m more sure that things will stop getting worse. That alone will be a win for everyone — even though the change was seemingly driven by Mark Zuckerberg’s desire to poach Dye, not Tim Cook and Apple’s senior leadership realizing they should have shitcanned him long ago.</p>

<p>Alan Dye is not untalented. But his talents at Apple were in politics. His political skill was so profound that it was <em>his</em> decision to leave, despite the fact that his tenure is considered a disaster by actual designers inside and outside the company. He obviously figured out how to please Apple’s senior leadership. His departure today landed as a total surprise because his stature within the company seemed so secure. And so I think he might do very well at Meta. Not because he can bring world-class interaction design expertise — because he obviously can’t — but because the path to success at Meta has never been driven by design. It’s about getting done what Zuck wants done. Dye might excel at that. Dye was an anchor holding Apple back, but might elevate design at Meta.<sup id="fnr5-2025-12-03"><a href="#fn5-2025-12-03">5</a></sup></p>

<p>My favorite reaction to today’s news is <a href="https://x.com/8hipulin/status/1996318006335401997">this one-liner from a guy on Twitter/X</a>: “The average IQ of both companies has increased.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1-2025-12-03">
<p>Titles are just titles, and title inflation is a real problem at all big companies. But I always thought C-level executives by definition report directly to the CEO. That that was the whole point of a “<em>chief whatever officer</em>” title versus “<em>senior vice president of whatever</em>”. But according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-03/apple-design-executive-alan-dye-poached-by-meta-in-major-coup">Mark Gurman’s exclusive report at Bloomberg</a> breaking this whole story (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the Dye hire, Meta is creating a new design studio and
putting him in charge of design for hardware, software and AI
integration for its interfaces. <em>He will be reporting to Chief
Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth</em>, who oversees Reality Labs.
That group is tasked with developing wearable devices, such as
smart glasses and virtual reality headsets. Dye’s major focus will
be revamping Meta’s consumer devices with artificial intelligence
features.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If true, Dye doesn’t even report directly to Mark Zuckerberg. Oddly enough, after <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/07/jeff_williams_is_retiring_as_coo">the retirement of COO Jeff Williams</a> this year, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-announces-chief-operating-officer-transition/">Apple claimed</a> the company’s design teams transitioned to reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-12-03"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>
</li>


<li id="fn2-2025-12-03">
<p>And man oh man am I curious who was involved with this decision, who had Tim Cook’s ear, and just how quickly they were forced to make it. Part of what made Stephen Lemay a popular choice within Apple’s ranks is that Lemay, by all accounts I’ve heard, isn’t a political operator and never angled for a promotion to a level of this prominence. His focus has always singularly been on the work.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2025-12-03"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<p>Sorrentino was featured in a two-minute-plus segment in this year’s WWDC keynote, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/0_DjDdfqtUE?t=2305">starting at the 38:25 mark</a>, introducing the new iOS Visual Intelligence features. His star was rising at Apple. And Dye himself, of course, was given the spotlight to introduce and effectively take credit for Liquid Glass itself. At least until recently, no one at Apple saw this coming.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr3-2025-12-03"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>
</li>


<li id="fn4-2025-12-03">
<p>I have good reason to believe that Ive, in private, would be the first person to admit that. A fan of Liquid Glass Jony Ive is not. I believe he sees Dye as a graphic designer, not a user interface designer — and not a good graphic designer at that. I don’t think Alan Dye could get a job as a barista at LoveFrom.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr4-2025-12-03"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>
</li>


<li id="fn5-2025-12-03">
<p>It’s worth recalling that Zuckerberg sorta kinda tried this <em>poach-design-talent-from-Apple</em> thing before. Mike Matas, the wunderkind designer who became <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/26/delicious-library-eol">a sensation with Delicious Library in 2005</a>, soon thereafter <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2005/07/21/matas">moved on to work at Apple</a>, where he designed such things as the “slide to unlock” interface on the original iPhone. Matas was a key designer on that glorious first version of the iPhone’s OS. He then left Apple and formed Push Pop Press, and wound up at Facebook in 2011 after Facebook acquired Push Pop — before it had even shipped its core product. (I saw a still-in-development version of Push Pop’s publishing system in 2011, before Facebook bought them and shut down the product, and it remains to this day one of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2011/02/push_pop_press">the most impressive, exciting, “this is the future” demos</a> I’ve ever seen. It’s not merely a shame but a goddamn tragedy that it never even shipped.) Zuckerberg wound up assembling around Matas an entire little superteam of <a href="https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/11/06/the-delicious-generation/">“Delicious” era</a> designers and design-focused developers. That team wound up shipping <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/30/5360358/facebook-paper-iphone-app">Facebook Paper in 2014</a> — an iOS-exclusive alternative client for Facebook that espoused the same principles of elegance, exquisite attention to detail, and, especially, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/3/5373488/facebook-paper-app-review">direct manipulation of content in lieu of user interface chrome</a>, that infused Push Pop Press’s publishing system. Facebook Paper was so good it almost — <em>almost</em> — made me sign up for a Facebook account just so I could use it. But Facebook Paper went nowhere, fast. Zuckerberg lost his boner for “design”, Facebook Paper was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/06/30/facebook-paper-dead/">pulled from the App Store</a> in 2016, and the team behind Paper disbanded.</p>

<p>Matas today works at LoveFrom, and remains, to my mind, one of the most singularly talented and interesting people in the field of interaction design. In some closer-to-ideal alternate universe, Matas would be running HI design at Apple today.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr5-2025-12-03"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<p>Back in July, I was lucky enough to have my friend Louie Mantia <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/07/31/ep-428">on The Talk Show</a> to talk about Liquid Glass and (as I wrote in the show notes) “the worrisome state of Apple’s UI design overall”. This was probably my favorite episode of the show all year, and I think it holds up extremely well now that we’re all using Liquid Glass, across Apple’s platforms, in release versions.</p>

<p>Included in the show notes was a link to Mantia’s essay making his case against Dye’s decade-long stint leading Apple’s UI design teams, “<a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/a-responsibility-to-the-industry.html">A Responsibility to the Industry</a>”, which began thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Firstly, I maintain that it makes absolutely no sense that Alan
Dye has the power he has, because he simply has no taste. But
what’s worse is that he wields that power so clumsily, so
carelessly. And because it goes unchallenged, unchecked by someone
higher than him, the entire industry suffers the consequences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://pdx.social/@louie/115657549705092757">Here’s Mantia today</a>, regarding the news of Dye leaving Apple for Meta:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And good riddance!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tyler Hall, just one week ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe it’s because my eyes are getting old or maybe it’s because
<a href="https://tyler.io/2020/09/surtainly-not/#active-window">the contrast between windows</a> on macOS keeps getting worse.
Either way, I built a tiny Mac app last night that draws a border
around the active window. I named it “Alan”.</p>

<p>In Alan’s preferences, you can choose a preferred border width and
colors for both light and dark mode.</p>

<p>That’s it. That’s the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The timing of this is remarkably serendipitous — releasing an app named “Alan” to fix an obvious glaring design shortcoming in recent versions of MacOS just one week before Alan Dye left Apple. (<a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/12/03/alan-and-aaron/">See Michael Tsai</a> for more on the app’s name, including a callback to <a href="https://www.mymac.com/interview-greg-landweber/">Greg Landweber</a>’s classic Mac OS extension <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/538-aaron-1-x">Aaron</a>.)</p>

<p>It’s worth following Hall’s “the contrast between windows” link, which points to <a href="https://tyler.io/2020/09/surtainly-not/#active-window">his own post from five years ago</a> lamenting the decline in contrast between active and inactive windows in MacOS. That 2020 post of Hall’s refers back to Steve Jobs’s introduction of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard in 2007:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As I was preparing the above video for this post, I completely
forgot there was a final feature about the new Leopard Desktop
that was highlighted in that keynote.</p>

<p>Jobs took time out of a keynote to callout that it was now easier
to tell which window is focused. At 1:29 in that clip, you’ll hear
an outsized “Wooo!” from some of the audience just for this one
improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jobs even <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/leopard-active-window.jpeg">prepared a slide</a>, highlighting “Prominent active window” as a noteworthy new feature. In 2007, the increase of visual prominence for the active window, going from 10.4 Tiger to 10.5 Leopard, drew applause from the audience. But the level of visual prominence indicating active/inactive windows was much higher <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2005/04/macosx-10-4/">in 10.4 Tiger</a> than in any version of MacOS in the last decade under Alan Dye’s leadership.</p>

<p><a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/alan-app/">Nick Heer on Alan</a> (the app, and, indirectly, the man):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wish it did not feel understandable for there to be an app that
draws a big border around the currently active window. That should
be something made sufficiently obvious by the system.
Unfortunately, this is a problem plaguing the latest versions of
MacOS and Windows alike, which is baffling to me. The bar for what
constitutes acceptable user interface design seems to have fallen
low enough that it is tripping everyone at the two major desktop
operating system vendors.</p>

<p>Mark Gurman, with blockbuster news at Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meta Platforms Inc. has poached Apple Inc.’s most prominent design
executive in a major coup that underscores a push by the social
networking giant into AI-equipped consumer devices.</p>

<p>The company is hiring Alan Dye, who has served as the head of
Apple’s user interface design team since 2015, according to people
with knowledge of the matter. Apple is replacing Dye with longtime
designer Stephen Lemay, according to the people, who asked not to
be identified because the personnel changes haven’t been
announced.</p>

<p>Apple confirmed the move in a statement provided to
Bloomberg News.</p>

<p>“Steve Lemay has played a key role in the design of every major
Apple interface since 1999,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said
in the statement. “He has always set an extraordinarily high bar
for excellence and embodies Apple’s culture of collaboration and
creativity.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sounds like Dye chose to jump ship, and wasn’t squeezed out (as it seems <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-03/apple-design-executive-alan-dye-poached-by-meta-in-major-coup?embedded-checkout=true">with former AI chief John Giannandrea</a> earlier this week). Gurman/Bloomberg are spinning this like a coup for Meta (headline: “Apple Design Executive Alan Dye Poached by Meta in Major Coup”), but I think this is the best personnel news at Apple in decades. Dye’s decade-long stint running Apple’s software design team has been, on the whole, terrible — and rather than getting better, the problems have been getting worse.</p>

<p>Todd Vaziri, on the HBO Max <em>Mad Men</em> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/02/hbo-max-butchers-mad-men">fiasco</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It appears as though this represents the original photography,
unaltered before digital visual effects got involved. Somehow,
this episode (along with many others) do not include all the
digital visual effects that were in the original broadcasts and
home video releases. It’s a bizarro mistake for Lionsgate and HBO
Max to make and not discover until after the show was streaming to
customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tvaziri.com/post/3m6zcqcrzsc2a">I decided to help illustrate the changes</a> by diving in and
creating images that might do better than words. The first thing I
noticed is that, at least for season one, the episode titles and
order were totally jumbled. The puke episode is “Red in the Face”,
not “Babylon”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So HBO Max not only ruined several episodes by “remastering” the wrong footage, but they both mis-numbered <em>and</em> mis-titled the episodes. Breathtaking ineptitude. Think about it. This is the entire <em>raison d’être</em> — streaming high quality movies and episodic series. That’s the one and only thing HBO Max does. And they have zero care or craft for what they do. They didn’t just do this to <em>any</em> show. They did it to one of the most cinematically beautiful and carefully crafted shows ever made.</p>

<p>Vaziri’s post, as is his wont, is replete with illustrated and animated examples of the mistakes in HBO’s versions compared to the correct originals available from AMC and iTunes. Vaziri notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The fun thing about this restoration mistake is that now we, the
audience, get to see exactly how many digital visual effects were
actually used in a show like “Mad Men”</em>, which most would assume
did not have any digital effects component. In this shot, not only
were the techs and hose removed, but the spot where the pretend
puke meets Slattery’s face has some clever digital warping to make
it seem like the flow is truly coming from his mouth (as opposed
to it appearing through a tube inches from his mouth, on the other
side of his face).</p>

<p>Alan Sepinwall, writing for Wired (<a href="https://apple.news/A7hteXTouRPitd6GIpZuOfA">News+ link</a> in case Wired’s paywall busts your balls):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last month, HBO Max announced a major new addition to its library.
Not only would the streamer be adding <em>Mad Men</em> — a show that HBO
execs infamously passed on back when Matthew Weiner was a writer
on <em>The Sopranos</em> — but it would be presenting the period drama’s
episodes in a new 4K remastering. This would, according to the
<a href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/hbo-max/mad-men-comes-hbo-max-december-1">press release</a>, give “audiences and longtime <em>Mad Men</em> fans
the opportunity to enjoy the series’ authentically crafted
elements with crisp detail and enhanced visual clarity.”</p>

<p>As it turned out, there was perhaps <em>too much</em> clarity. Not long
after the series went live on HBO Max, a screencap began floating
around social media from a scene in the Season One episode “Red in
the Face,” where Roger Sterling is vomiting in front of a group of
horrified Sterling Cooper clients. When it aired — and in the
version still available on AMC+ — seven men are onscreen, all of
them wearing period-appropriate suits and ties. The HBO Max
version, on the other hand, features two men who appear very out
of place in 1960: crew members lurking in the background, feeding
a hose to create the illusion that actor John Slattery is puking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not like the crew members are only partially on-screen, or out of focus far in the background. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/mad-men-hbo-max-puke.jpeg">They’re right there</a>. It’s glaringly obvious that no one at HBO Max even watched this. That’s how rotten the culture at Warner Bros. Discovery is. They obtained the rights to one of the greatest TV shows ever made (one that I personally hold alongside <em>The Sopranos</em> as my favorite ever), processed the episodes in some sort of “remastering” <em>that did not need to happen</em>, and didn’t even bother to watch the fucking new versions they produced before putting them on their service for the world to stream.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amcplus.com/mad-men">AMC+ has the entire original series</a>, as originally broadcast, and it looks gorgeous. I bought <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/mad-men/umc.cmc.260bmp43ucaq656rs0tw6aioj">all seven seasons from iTunes</a> back in the day, and they look as good, if not better, in those versions. David Zaslav — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/13/zaslav-hbo-max">a well-known idiot</a> — should go to prison for this.</p>

<p>Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil, reporting for Reuters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple does not plan to comply with a mandate to preload its
smartphones with a state-owned cyber safety app and will
convey its concerns to New Delhi, three sources said, after
the government’s move sparked surveillance concerns and a
political uproar.</p>

<p>The Indian government has confidentially ordered companies
including Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi to preload their phones with
an app called Sanchar Saathi, or Communication Partner, within 90
days. The app is intended to track stolen phones, block them and
prevent them from being misused.</p>

<p>The government also wants manufacturers to ensure that the app is
not disabled. And for devices already in the supply chain,
manufacturers should push the app to phones via software updates,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/india-orders-mobile-phones-preloaded-with-government-app-ensure-cyber-safety-2025-12-01/">Reuters was first to report on</a> Monday. [...]</p>

<p>Apple however does not plan to comply with the directive and will
tell the government it does not follow such mandates anywhere in
the world as they raise a host of privacy and security issues for
the company’s iOS ecosystem, said two of the industry sources who
are familiar with Apple’s concerns. They declined to be named
publicly as the company’s strategy is private.</p>

<p>The second source said Apple does not plan to go to court or take
a public stand, but it will tell the government it cannot follow
the order because of security vulnerabilities. Apple “can’t do
this. Period,” the person said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To my knowledge, there are no government-mandated apps pre-installed on iPhones anywhere in the world. I’m not even sure how that would work, technically, given that third-party apps have to come from the App Store and thus can’t be installed until after the iPhone is configured and the user signs into their App Store Apple Account.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The app order comes as Apple is locked in a court fight with an
Indian watchdog over the nation’s antitrust penalty law. Apple has
said it risks facing a fine of up to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-contests-indias-antitrust-penalty-law-with-risk-38-billion-fine-filing-2025-11-26/">$38 billion in a case</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is another one of those laws like the EU’s DMA, where maximum <em>possible</em> fines are based on a percentage of global revenue. No one in India seems to actually be threatening any such fine, but it’s ludicrous that it’s even possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/01/giannandrea-out">Speaking of</a> Apple executive HR news, in his Power On Bloomberg column last weekend, Mark Gurman pooh-poohed <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/15/ft-apple-tim-cook-succession">the Financial Times’s recent report</a> that Tim Cook was likely to retire early next year (paywalled, alas, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/23/gurman-on-tim-cook-remaining-apple-ceo/">summarized by MacRumors</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In October, I wrote that the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-10-05/who-will-be-apple-s-next-ceo-after-tim-cook-apple-shelves-vision-air-m5-ipad">internal spotlight on Ternus was
“intensifying,”</a> and that barring unforeseen circumstances
he would be the leading candidate. But I didn’t put a date on when
a change might happen. Then, around midnight two Fridays ago, the
Financial Times published a report with three central claims:
Apple is “intensifying” succession planning; Ternus is likely the
next CEO; and Cook is expected to step down between late January
and June.</p>

<p>The first two points are anything but revelations if you’ve read
Bloomberg coverage and Power On, or have simply been paying
attention to the realities of Cook’s age and tenure. The timing,
however, is another matter entirely. It’s a huge deal that the FT
did this: A respected publication should only predict the CEO
transition date for a company of Apple’s scale with a high level
of confidence — based on people legitimately in the know.</p>

<p>This is where I have concerns. Based on everything I’ve learned in
recent weeks, I don’t believe a departure by the middle of next
year is likely. In fact, I would be shocked if Cook steps down in
the time frame outlined by the FT. Some people have speculated
that the story was a “test balloon” orchestrated by Apple or
someone close to Cook to prepare Wall Street for a change, but
that isn’t the case either. I believe the story was simply false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can’t both be right. Either the Financial Times or Bloomberg and Gurman will have a serving of claim chowder no later than June. But as Gurman points out, the only disagreement in their reporting is regarding timing: soon vs. soon-ish.</p>

<p>It could be that we see something like the following next year. Current board chairman Arthur Levinson turned 75 this year, the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/01/26/apple-will-be-on-the-hunt-for-two-new-board-members-soon">suggested age limit</a> for Apple Board members. So maybe he rides off into the sunset and Apple names Cook, who already has a seat on the board, executive chairman. Maybe in February, ahead of Apple’s annual shareholder meeting. Then, in the second half of the year, Cook steps down as CEO, Ternus takes the CEO job, and Cook remains chairman of the board for the next decade or so. One change at a time, with a drip-drip series of leaks to trusted business news publications, like the one to the Financial Times last month — seemingly from the board itself — to make none of it come as a surprise.</p>

<p>I don’t think the leak — from multiple sources — to the FT was a “test balloon” (cue John Siracusa on <a href="https://atp.fm/666">ATP 666</a> regarding “<em>trial</em> balloon” being the correct idiom). It was more of a “<em>heads up, this is what’s coming</em>”.</p>

<p>Apple Newsroom, “John Giannandrea to Retire From Apple”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced John Giannandrea, Apple’s senior vice
president for Machine Learning and AI Strategy, is stepping down
from his position and will serve as an advisor to the company
before retiring in the spring of 2026. Apple also announced that
renowned AI researcher Amar Subramanya has joined Apple as vice
president of AI, reporting to Craig Federighi. Subramanya will be
leading critical areas, including Apple Foundation Models, ML
research, and AI Safety and Evaluation. The balance of
Giannandrea’s organization will shift to Sabih Khan and Eddy Cue
to align closer with similar organizations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">the fiasco around Apple Intelligence and the “more personalized Siri” features</a> — which were announced at WWDC in June 2024, but postponed until 2026 in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">a tail-between-their-legs announcement in March 2025</a> — and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/gurman-rockwell-siri">the executive reshuffling immediately after that delay was announced</a> that put Mike Rockwell in charge of Siri and moved all or most of Apple Intelligence and Siri under Craig Federighi, it would have been much more surprising if Giannandrea had stayed at Apple. In fact, I’m surprised he wasn’t out before WWDC this past June.</p>

<p>I don’t think we need to wait for additional details to know that he was squeezed out. If, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-20/apple-vision-pro-chief-mike-rockwell-named-siri-head-giannandrea-keeps-ai-role">as Mark Gurman reported back in March</a>, “Tim Cook has lost confidence in the ability of AI head John Giannandrea to execute on product development”, why was he still there?</p>

<p>As for Subramanya, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amar-subramanya-3642498a/">according to his LinkedIn profile</a>, he was at Google for 16 years, and left to join Microsoft <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amar-subramanya-3642498a_super-excited-to-share-that-ive-started-activity-7353453746091081729-ElkV">only five months ago</a>. Either he didn’t like working at Microsoft, or Apple made him an offer he couldn’t refuse (or, perhaps, both).</p>

	<summary type="text">A user-hostile “lose your phone, lose your account history” architecture may well be “secure” in a technical sense, but it’s the sort of brittleness that’s kept Signal from achieving more mainstream use.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/9708267671322-Signal-Secure-Backups">Signal Support</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Signal Secure Backups can help you safely restore your chats
if something unexpected happens to your device (like dropping
your phone in a lake). When this optional feature is enabled,
your device will automatically back up your message history so
you won’t lose important data if you get a new phone or
reinstall Signal.</p>

<p>Your Secure Backup Archive is end-to-end encrypted and protected
by a cryptographically secure 64-character recovery key that is
never shared with the Signal service. Without your unique recovery
key, no one (including Signal) can read, decrypt, or restore any
of the data in your Secure Backup Archive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Signal’s cloud storage service is optional (of course), and available to all users free of charge. At the free tier, it will back up the complete text of users’ chat history and the last 45 days of file attachments (images, video, etc.). For $2/month (through in-app purchase in the iPhone app), Signal will remove the 45-day window on media attachments, and store up to 100 GB of attachments — which, for most users, should be their complete history. (I don’t remember how far back in time my iCloud iMessage storage goes, but, as I type this, it includes 772,004 messages and consumes 83.4 GB of storage. I have a <em>lot</em> of images in there. 100 GB of storage feels pretty good for $2/month. My personal Signal account backup size is just 408 MB, which jibes with my gut feeling regarding how much I use Signal compared to iMessage — about one-half of one percent as much.)</p>

<p><a href="https://signal.org/blog/introducing-secure-backups/">Signal first announced this feature back in September</a> in a blog post that has a lot of technical details about how it works, but <a href="https://x.com/signalapp/status/1993018186690871409">until a week ago</a>, it was only available on the Android version. It’s still labelled as a “beta” feature on iOS. I enabled it over the weekend and signed up for the $2/month subscription — both to back up all my attachments and to support the Signal Foundation. Now that I’m paying $2/month, however, I wish they’d stop periodically badgering me for donations when I launch the app.</p>

<p>I’m glad this feature became available when it did, and that I enabled it over the weekend. Yesterday I set up my personal new iPhone this year, and this morning, when I tried to transfer my Signal account from my old iPhone to the new one, after claiming to reach “100%” of the transfer, and the Signal app reporting on both the old (source) and new (destination) phones that the transfer was complete, the app crashed on both phones. After that, the Signal app was in factory-fresh state on both phones, without any trace of my account history. I then restored the new iPhone from my brand-new online Signal Secure Backup, and that worked perfectly. And it somehow took far, far less time than the old device-to-device transfer — maybe one minute, versus 15 minutes or so for the device-to-device transfer that wound up failing.</p>

<p>Until now, transferring my Signal account history from one phone to another always felt like delivering a crate full of eggs while riding a rickety old bicycle without brakes on a bumpy cobblestone street. Every time I did it device-to-device, it felt like I’d be lucky if it worked. And my experience trying it this morning — for the last time — proved me right. Signal proponents often defended this architecture by arguing that remaining only on device was a security benefit. In some ways that’s true, but there’s nothing “secure” about a transfer feature that loses all of your data if the transfer fails. (Signal data, by design, isn’t included in iCloud backups because Apple holds a key to unlock iCloud backups for customer service reasons, unless the user has enabled <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756">Advanced Data Protection</a>.) Permanently losing all your data is a different form of “insecurity” than having it exfiltrated by an attacker or exposed to law enforcement agencies via a warrant issued to the cloud backup provider, but it’s a form of insecurity nonetheless.</p>

<p>Signal’s top priority has always been protecting your data from being obtained by others. That’s a noble idea, and central to Signal’s brand. But by placing that priority so far above everything else, it meant, until now, that you’d lose your entire account history if you lost or broke your primary phone. This new secure backup system shows that your data can remain secure while also being backed up off device. I’m glad the feature is finally here, but it should have been here years ago. A user-hostile “lose your phone, lose your account history” architecture may well be “secure” in a technical sense, but it’s the sort of brittleness that’s kept Signal from achieving more mainstream use.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/05/festivitas">Last year</a> developer Simon Støvring launched a fun new app for the Mac called Festivitas, which let you decorate your menu bar and Dock with animated holiday lights and falling snow.

<p>Sam Roberts, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>David Lerner, a high school dropout and self-taught computer geek
whose funky foothold in New York’s Flatiron district, Tekserve,
was for decades a beloved discount mecca for Apple customers
desperate to retrieve lost data and repair frozen hard drives,
died on Nov. 12 at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 72. [...]</p>

<p>Tekserve specialized in finding the cures for sick computers — including insect infestations — and recovering first novels and
other priceless data, which the company said it was able to do
about 85 percent of the time.</p>

<p>“We only charged for success,” Mr. Lerner said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were many great independent Apple resellers from the pre-Apple-Store era. There was only one that was legendary: Tekserve.</p>

<p>Regarding my earlier post on similarities between the 2010 App Store Guidelines and today’s: Notably absent from the current guidelines (I think for a very long time) is the specious but very Jobsian claim that “If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps.” Getting the press on your side is one of the <em>best</em> ways for a developer to get an unjust App Store review decision overturned. Apple <em>loathes</em> negative publicity.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Here’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#design">the updated full guideline for section 4.1</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4.1 Copycats</p>

<p>(a) Come up with your own ideas. We know you have them, so make
    yours come to life. Don’t simply copy the latest popular app
    on the App Store, or make some minor changes to another app’s
    name or UI and pass it off as your own. In addition to risking
    an intellectual property infringement claim, it makes the App
    Store harder to navigate and just isn’t fair to your fellow
    developers.</p>

<p>(b) Submitting apps which impersonate other apps or services is
    considered a violation of the Developer Code of Conduct and
    may result in removal from the Apple Developer Program.</p>

<p>(c) You cannot use another developer’s icon, brand, or product
    name in your app’s icon or name, without approval from the
    developer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s guideline (c) that’s new, but I like guideline (a) here. Not just the intent of it, but the language. It’s clear, direct, and human. It reminds me of the tone of the very early guidelines, when it seemed like Steve Jobs’s voice was detectable in some of them. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/09/app_store_guidelines">In a post back in 2010, I wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This new document is written in remarkably casual language. For
example, a few bullet items from the beginning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li><p>We have over 250,000 apps in the App Store. We don’t need any
more Fart apps.</p></li>
<li><p>If your app doesn’t do something useful or provide some form of
lasting entertainment, it may not be accepted.</p></li>
<li><p>If your App looks like it was cobbled together in a few days, or
you’re trying to get your first practice App into the store to
impress your friends, please brace yourself for rejection. We
have lots of serious developers who don’t want their quality
Apps to be surrounded by amateur hour.</p></li>
<li><p>We will reject Apps for any content or behavior that we believe
is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court
Justice once said, “I’ll know it when I see it”. And we think
that you will also know it when you cross it.</p></li>
<li><p>If your app is rejected, we have a Review Board that you can
appeal to. If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of that language remains today. Here’s the current guideline for section 4.3:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4.3 Spam [...]</p>

<p>(b) Also avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated;
    the App Store has enough fart, burp, flashlight, fortune
    telling, dating, drinking games, and Kama Sutra apps, etc.
    already. We will reject these apps unless they provide a
    unique, high-quality experience. Spamming the store may lead
    to your removal from the Apple Developer Program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could be wrong, but my sense is that Apple has, without much fanfare, cracked down on scams and rip-offs in the App Store. That doesn’t mean there’s none. But it’s like crime in a city: a low amount of crime is the practical ideal, not zero crime. Maybe Apple has empowered something like the “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/bunco+squad">bunco squad</a>” I’ve wanted for years? If I’m just unaware of blatant rip-offs running wild in the App Store, send examples my way.</p>

to an idea that there’s a pseudo-human spying on you is bad. Alexa

	<summary type="text">The bottom line is that users setting up new Apple Watches in the EU will now get a somewhat slightly worse experience in the name of parity with accessories made by third-party companies. It remains to be seen whether users of third-party iPhone accessories and peripherals in the EU will see any benefit at all.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>There have been several new features that have been delayed in the EU while Apple tried to make them compliant with the DMA. iPhone Mirroring <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120421">debuted over a year ago with iOS 18 and MacOS 15 Sequoia</a>, but still remains unavailable today in the EU. Apple Intelligence <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/01/apple-intelligence-is-now-fully-supported-in-the-eu-with-ios-18-4/">was delayed in the EU until iOS 18.4</a> in April, but was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-releases-ios-18-1/">available to most of the world in 18.1</a> last October. And, both most recently and briefly, the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/123185">live translation feature</a> for AirPods Pro 3, AirPods Pro 2, and AirPods 4, which debuted outside the EU with the launch of iOS 26.0 in September, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ie/newsroom/2025/11/live-translation-on-airpods-expands-to-the-eu/">will only become available in the EU next month</a>, with the launch of iOS 26.2.</p>

<p>But now comes word of the first feature that Apple is limiting or removing in an existing product to comply with the DMA: Wi-Fi network sync between iPhone and Apple Watch, which is poised to change in the EU next month, with the 26.2 releases of iOS and WatchOS. The news was broken by Nicolas Lellouche, <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/2110247-lapple-watch-et-liphone-vont-perdre-une-fonction-en-europe-pour-la-premiere-fois-annonce-apple.html">reporting for the French-language site Numerama</a>. I’m quoting here from Safari’s English translation of his original report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has been warning for several months that it could one day,
if it deems it necessary, disable functions in the European Union
to “protect its users”. This day could arrive in December, with
the iOS 26.2 update.</p>

<p>On November 4, Apple announced to Numerama that it had made the
decision to disable Wi-Fi synchronization between an iPhone and an
Apple Watch in Europe so as not to have to comply with the
European Commission’s request, which wants to force it by the end
of 2025 to open the iPhone’s Wi-Fi to third-party accessories.
This announcement follows the opening of the AirPods Live
Translation function in Europe, with a new API to allow
competitors to use the microphones and speakers of AirPods and
iPhone simultaneously. [...]</p>

<p>Apple indicates that the European Commission is asking it to
replicate the link between an iPhone and an Apple Watch, but with
third-party products. Apple, after thinking long about how to
implement this function, finally decided to reject the European
request. Since Europe requires that third-party products be
treated like the Apple Watch, then Apple disables the function on
Apple Watch. This allows it to comply with the DMA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lellouche’s report at Numerama broke this story (the reports at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/06/iphone-apple-watch-wi-fi-sync-eu-ios/">MacRumors</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/05/ios-26-2-will-remove-a-key-iphone-and-apple-watch-feature-in-eu-per-report/">9to5Mac</a> are both based on Numerama’s), but the above is not an accurate summary of what Apple is doing with iOS 26.2.<sup id="fnr1-2025-11-22"><a href="#fn1-2025-11-22">1</a></sup> Apple <em>is</em> complying with the DMA, and they’re <em>not</em> disabling Wi-Fi network synchronization between an iPhone and a paired Apple Watch. What Apple is doing, in order to comply with the DMA, is changing how Wi-Fi networks sync with Apple Watch (in the EU), and offering new APIs in the EU for third-party paired devices to put them on equal (or near-equal?) footing with Apple Watch (in the EU).</p>

<p>This change should be relatively limited. Honestly, I don’t think many Apple Watch users in the EU will even notice. But it is at least mildly annoying, and the relatively minor, very specific nature of this particular DMA mandate makes it a telling example of the European Commission’s overreach.</p>

<p>Currently, when you pair a new Apple Watch with an iPhone, iOS transfers to WatchOS the iPhone’s entire list of saved Wi-Fi networks and their passwords — directly, device-to-device. As iOS learns of new networks that the user joins from their iPhone, that information continues to be shared with any Apple Watches paired to that iPhone. The utility of this is that if you’re wearing your Apple Watch, but don’t have your iPhone nearby, your watch will join an available saved Wi-Fi network at your location. Let’s say you go for a run or walk, with only your Apple Watch, and you stop at a cafe for a beverage. If you’ve ever joined the Wi-Fi network at that cafe from your iPhone (or iPad or Mac, assuming you sync your Apple Keychain via iCloud), your Apple Watch will join that network automatically. It should, and in my personal experience does, just work.</p>

<p>The EU mandate to Apple is <em>not</em> that Apple must grant to third-party devices and their iOS companion applications this same functionality as it stands today — that is to say, access to the entire history of the iPhone’s known Wi-Fi networks. The EU mandate is that Apple must grant to third-party devices the same level of access to Wi-Fi network information that Apple Watch has. Apple is complying with this mandate in two ways: (a) by changing how much Wi-Fi network information an Apple Watch gets from the iPhone to which it is paired; and (b) creating a new framework in iOS 26.2 (gated by a new entitlement), <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/wifiinfrastructure">Wi-Fi Infrastructure</a>, that provides a set of public APIs, available only to apps in the EU, to (per the framework’s description) “share Wi-Fi network credentials securely between devices and connected accessories.”</p>

<p>The change for Apple Watch in the EU is that starting with iOS 26.2, when a new (or reset) Apple Watch is set up, the Apple Watch will no longer have the user’s list of saved Wi-Fi networks automatically synced from their iPhone. Only future networks will be synced — the same level of access that the new Wi-Fi Infrastructure framework is making available to third-party accessories.</p>

<p>Under the new rules for Apple Watch in the EU, an existing (that is to say, already configured) watch that is upgraded to WatchOS 26.2 will still remember all Wi-Fi networks it already knew about. But a new Apple Watch will only be able to automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks that its associated iPhone saves <em>after</em> the Apple Watch was set up and paired. So when an EU Apple Watch owner with a new watch visits a known location, and doesn’t have their iPhone with them, the watch won’t be able to join that location’s Wi-Fi automatically, unless the paired iPhone has connected to and saved that network <em>after</em> the watch was paired.</p>

<p>With iOS 26.2, the behavior for users outside the EU will remain unchanged from iOS 26.1 and prior — both for Apple Watch and for third-party accessories.</p>

<p>A user’s Wi-Fi history can be used to glean significant information about them. Who they know (other homes’ networks), where they’ve been (medical providers, restaurants, airports), and more. Apple’s new policy for Apple Watch and third-party devices is DMA-compliant and prevents the sharing of historical networks, but with the sharing of future networks as the associated iPhone joins them, there’s still a risk here of third-party companies doing things with the user’s Wi-Fi network information that the user doesn’t understand, or want (but doesn’t realize they’ve consented to).</p>

<p>One way to look at Apple’s options for complying with this particular DMA mandate is by considering the extremes. On the one extreme, Apple could have just granted third-party peripherals in the EU the exact same access to users’ iPhone Wi-Fi network history that Apple Watch has gotten until now (and will continue to get outside the EU). On the other extreme, Apple could have cut off Wi-Fi network syncing to the Apple Watch altogether, requiring users to connect to each Wi-Fi network manually, using the Watch itself or the Apple Watch app on iPhone. Instead, Apple chose a middle ground — limiting Wi-Fi network history sync to the Apple Watch in the EU in ways that it isn’t limited anywhere else in the world, but granting third-party accessories in the EU access to these new Wi-Fi Infrastructure APIs that aren’t available outside the EU.</p>

<p>Critics might argue that while this middle ground is technically compliant with the DMA, it’s not compliant with the <em>intention</em> of the DMA, which would be for the Apple Watch not to lose any functionality in the EU, and for Apple to provide APIs to allow third-party devices all of the Wi-Fi syncing features currently available to Apple Watch. Apple would argue, and I agree, that the European Commission’s intentions are incoherent in this regard. The EC insists that Apple should protect users’ privacy and security, while also insisting that Apple grant access to third-party apps and devices that can potentially compromise users’ privacy and security.</p>

<p>There’s a reason why Apple isn’t offering the new Wi-Fi Infrastructure framework outside the EU, and that’s because they don’t believe it’s a good idea to grant any access at all to your saved Wi-Fi networks to third-party apps and devices. Especially without being able to specify, let alone enforce, a policy that Wi-Fi network information should be treated the way Apple treats it — remaining exclusively on device.</p>

<p>The skeptical take on Apple’s motivations in this situation is that Apple is spitefully removing functionality from Apple Watch rather than offering new APIs to provide third-party devices with the same functionality that Apple Watch currently has, and that Apple’s intention here is, somehow, primarily about trying to drive anti-DMA sentiment amongst its EU users. This is, in fact, the skeptical take on every single aspect of Apple’s compliance with the DMA: spiteful “malicious compliance” that, somehow, is intended to engender grassroots opposition to the DMA amongst Apple customers in the EU. I don’t think that’s an accurate take overall, but in this particular case with Apple Watch and Wi-Fi network sync, it’s almost silly.</p>

<p>Part of what makes this particular situation clarifying is that it’s so specific. It’s not about allowing third-party devices and their corresponding iOS apps to do <em>everything</em> that Apple Watches, and the Apple Watch iOS companion app, can do. It’s very specifically about the sharing of known Wi-Fi networks. (There will, surely, be other such situations to come regarding other features, for other Apple devices.) And as I described above, very few Apple Watch owners in the EU are likely to notice the change. How many Apple Watch users today realize that their watch automatically connects to known Wi-Fi networks when their iPhone is outside Bluetooth range?</p>

<p>If Apple were motivated by spite, and were trying to turn EU Apple Watch owners against the DMA, they’d just remove all Wi-Fi network syncing between the watch and its paired iPhone. Not just the historical list of all networks the iPhone has ever connected to, but the continuous sync of new networks the iPhone joins after the Apple Watch is paired. <em>That</em> would be a change Apple Watch users would be more likely to notice. But it’s not what Apple is doing. They’ve engineered an entire framework of public APIs to comply with the EC’s mandate.</p>

<p>But the reporting to date on this situation, starting with Numerama, paints the picture that Apple <em>is</em> dropping all Wi-Fi sync between WatchOS and iOS in the EU, and that Apple is refusing to make Wi-Fi network information available to third-party accessories.</p>

<p><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/11/06/ios-26-2-to-remove-iphone-apple-watch-wi-fi-sync-in-eu/">Here’s Michael Tsai</a>, after quoting from Tim Hardwick’s summary at MacRumors of Numerama’s report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems perfectly reasonable that if I have a third-party watch I
should be able to opt into having my phone share Wi-Fi info with
it. You can debate whether mandating this is the proper role of
government, but the status quo is clearly anti-competitive and bad
for the user experience. I’m open to hearing a story where Apple’s
position makes sense, but so far it just seems like FUD to me.
What is the argument, exactly? That Fitbit, which already has its
own GPS, is going to sell your access point–based location
history? That Facebook is going to trick you into granting access
to their app even though they have no corresponding device?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tsai is making a few wrong assumptions here. First, Apple <em>is</em> enabling users (in the EU) to opt into having their iPhone share Wi-Fi information with third-party devices. Second, this mandate is not specific to smartwatches — it applies to any devices that can pair with an iPhone and have corresponding iOS partner apps. So Meta, with their lineup of smartglasses, <em>does</em> have corresponding devices. And, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-slams-metas-numerous-interoperability-requests-2024-12-18/">per Apple’s public statements</a>, it is Meta in particular that has been zealously pursuing interoperability mandates pursuant to the DMA. I think it’s entirely possible that this entire issue regarding Wi-Fi network sharing was prompted by Meta’s interoperability requests to the European Commission.<sup id="fnr2-2025-11-22"><a href="#fn2-2025-11-22">2</a></sup></p>

<p>As for the argument regarding why Apple has chosen to comply in this way, what is essential to note is that <em>none</em> of this Wi-Fi network information shared between iOS and WatchOS <em>is ever sent to or seen by Apple</em>. Apple doesn’t see the network passwords, doesn’t see the names of the networks, and doesn’t even know when a device has joined a new network. All of this is exclusively on-device, and when the information is exchanged between an iPhone and paired Apple Watch, it’s transferred device-to-device. (This is also true when you use Apple’s features to share Wi-Fi passwords with nearby friends. It’s device-to-device and entirely private and secure. Apple doesn’t even know that person A sent a Wi-Fi password to person B, let alone know the name of the network or the password.)</p>

<p><a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/links/2025/11/07/0732">Here’s Rui Carmo, at Tao of Mac</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As someone who relies a lot on the Watch (especially now that
WhatsApp works locally on it), I’d say we have officially reached
the point where Apple is on the verge of actively harming their
user experience for no good reason whatsoever. I honestly don’t
know if this is bull-headedness or malicious compliance.</p>

<p>On the other hand, someone at the EU clearly prefers being in the
limelight by regulating against evil US corporations in ways that
affect very small parts of the general population rather than,
say, go after Asian smart TV manufacturers that are present in
millions of homes and resell data on Europeans’ TV viewing habits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No notes on Carmo’s second point. But regarding the first, his opinion is founded on incorrect assumptions. Apple clearly thinks it’s a bad idea to share any Wi-Fi information at all with third-party devices, but they’ve created an entire new framework for use within the EU to allow it, just so they can continue syncing any Wi-Fi network information at all with Apple Watch. Far from harming the user experience, Apple is bending over backwards to make the Apple Watch experience as good as possible while balancing the privacy and security implications of this DMA mandate. Rather than take away all Wi-Fi network syncing, Apple is leaving most of it in place, and only eliminating (in the EU) the part at the very beginning, where, during the set up process, all of the current networks saved on the iPhone are synced to the Apple Watch.</p>

<p>Given the mandate regarding the DMA, and given the privacy implications of sharing any of this information with third-party developers and peripheral makers, personally, I think it would have been reasonable for Apple to take the extreme position of simply disallowing Wi-Fi network information syncing to any and all devices, including Apple Watches, in the EU. There is no reason to trust third-party developers with any of this information. But Apple isn’t doing that, and they’ve undertaken a significant software engineering effort — just for the EU — to support the path they’ve chosen. Carmo’s critique seems predicated on the assumption that Apple is just cutting off all Wi-Fi network sharing.</p>

<p>Given that Apple’s compliance needs to account for potentially untrustworthy device makers — whether by <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/08/23/meta-lawsuit-settlement-facebook-location-tracking">intent</a>, or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/portable-lifeprint-printer-app-on-ios-and-android-leaked-millions-of-user-photos-and-sensitive-data-this-is-what-we-know">incompetence</a> — not syncing all known networks seems like a reasonable trade-off.</p>

<p>Leave it to <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1986222627003023630?s=20">Tim Sweeney to espouse the maximalist perspective</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why simply not ask the user whether or not to share WiFi history
identically whether connecting to an Apple product or a Meta
product?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, in fact, what Apple is doing. But the privacy implications for a user are, in fact, different when an iPhone’s saved Wi-Fi networks are shared to, say, a Meta product than to another Apple product. It’s worth emphasizing that the European Commission’s mandate does not permit Apple to require those third-party companies to treat this information with the same privacy protections that Apple does. Apple keeps that information exclusively on-device, but Apple is not permitted to require third-party peripheral makers to do the same.</p>

<p>Consider <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102420">the iOS system prompt for App Tracking Transparency</a>: the user’s two choices are “Ask App Not to Track” and “Allow”. It’s a common and natural question why the first option is “Ask App Not to Track” rather than “Don’t Allow”. It would certainly look better if the options were “Don’t Allow” and “Allow”. But Apple deliberately made the first button “Ask App Not to Track” because ATT is, at least partially, a <em>policy</em>, not a complete technical guarantee. If an app prompts for ATT permission and the user chooses “Ask App Not to Track”, that app should definitely <em>not</em> go ahead and attempt to track the user’s activity across other apps. But, technically, it could try.<sup id="fnr3-2025-11-22"><a href="#fn3-2025-11-22">3</a></sup> I presume that if they do, if and when Apple notices, Apple will rap the developer’s knuckles in the App Store review process, or even suspend the app’s developer account. But one can see why Apple would want to avoid <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/facebook-and-google-offered-gift-cards-for-root-level-access-to-ios-users-data/">such a pissing match with Facebook/Meta again</a>.<sup id="fnr4-2025-11-22"><a href="#fn4-2025-11-22">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Under the EU’s mandate to Apple regarding Wi-Fi network access for third-party devices and their corresponding iOS apps, Apple is not permitted even to set a policy that these apps must pinky swear to keep the information private and on-device. Nor is the EU itself demanding it. If a third-party device-maker wants to send your iPhone’s Wi-Fi network history and credentials to their servers and save it, that’s up to them, <em>not</em> Apple, per the EC. Apple sees that as a problem.<sup id="fnr5-2025-11-22"><a href="#fn5-2025-11-22">5</a></sup> You can argue — and some will, as I think Michael Tsai does in the passage I quote above, and as Tim Sweeney clearly does — that this ought to be up to the user. If a user says they’re fine with their Wi-Fi network information being shared with a third-party accessory they’ve paired with their iPhone, that’s up to them. That is a reasonable take. But I also think Apple’s perspective is reasonable as well — that they should be able to make products where this isn’t possible.</p>

<p>The “it should be up to the user” take benefits informed, technically savvy users. The “it shouldn’t be possible” take benefits uninformed, un-savvy users — users who in many cases have decided that they simply trust Apple. The iPhone brand message — the brand message behind the Apple ecosystem — is that Apple doesn’t allow things that are dangerous to security or privacy. I do not think most iPhone users expect a third-party device they pair to their iPhone to be able to send their entire history of Wi-Fi networks back to the company that made the device. (Most iPhone users also don’t realize how sensitive, privacy-wise, their complete Wi-Fi network history is.)</p>

<p>It’s fair to point out that the “it should be up to the user” take is more beneficial to third-party accessory makers than the “it shouldn’t be possible” take. And that this conflict of interest — where the same limitations that protect iPhone users’ privacy by definition disadvantage third-party devices in ways that Apple’s own devices that connect to iPhones are not — works not just in iPhone users’ favor, privacy-wise, but also in Apple’s favor, financially. Apple can sell more Apple Watches if they work better with iPhones than smartwatches from other companies do. That’s obviously true, but that’s just another way of saying that first-party products have inherent advantages that third-party products don’t, to which I say: <em>Duh</em>. Apple’s own peripherals, like Apple Watch, can do things that third-party peripherals can’t because Apple can trust its own devices, and its own software, in ways that it can’t trust devices and companion apps made by other companies.</p>

<p>It’s natural for a company to bootstrap a new product on the back of an existing successful one. Meta’s Threads social network, for example, uses the same usernames and sign-in system as Instagram, which is arguably the most successful social network in the world. Should Meta not have been permitted to do that? Or should they be forced to allow <em>anyone</em> to create new competing social networks using Instagram user accounts as the ID system?</p>

<p>It’d be pretty weird if Apple limited itself, when designing and engineering features that integrate experiences across <em>its own</em> devices, to what it would allow third-party developers to do. It’d be even weirder if Apple allowed third-party developers to do everything Apple’s own software can do.<sup id="fnr6-2025-11-22"><a href="#fn6-2025-11-22">6</a></sup></p>

<p>For at least the last <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/nack_control">15 years</a>, I’ve <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Adaringfireball.net%20apple%27s%20priorities%3A%20apple%20first%2C%20users%20second%2C%20developers%20third&amp;udm=14">repeatedly</a> emphasized that Apple’s priorities <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut">are in this order</a>: Apple first, users second, developers third. The DMA attempts to invert that order, privileging developers first (in the ostensible name of fair competition with Apple, a designated “gatekeeper”), ahead of users, and ahead of Apple itself. So of course Apple is going to object to and resist mandates that require it to subordinate its own strategic desires — its own sense of how its products ought to be designed and engineered — especially when the primary beneficiary of the mandates aren’t users, but developers. Many of whom, especially the larger ones, are Apple’s competitors. But I also think it’s clear, with Apple in particular, that users prefer Apple’s priorities. People are happier with Apple putting users’ considerations ahead of developers’ than they are when developers are free to run roughshod over the software platform.</p>

<p>The clearest example of that is the App Store. It’s overwhelmingly developers, not users, who object to the App Store model — the exclusivity of distribution, the exclusivity of the vendor’s payment system, the vendor’s payment commissions, the vendor’s functional guidelines and restrictions, all of it. Users largely don’t have a problem with any of that. That’s why Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/files/DMA-Study-Nov-2025.pdf">commissioned and then publicized a study</a>, just this month, that showed that DMA-driven changes saved developers €20 million in commissions, but that reduction in commissions didn’t lower the prices users pay. Developer-focused observers <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-dma-commission-study/">see that as a win for the DMA</a> — that’s €20 million in developers’ pockets that otherwise would have gone into Apple’s already overflowing pockets. But a user-focused observer might see that as clarifying regarding the fact that the DMA wasn’t designed to benefit users, and isn’t benefiting users in practice either. Apple doesn’t care about €20 million. They fart bigger than that. They do care about clarifying who the DMA prioritizes first, and that it’s not users. (And, of course, that it’s not Apple itself.)</p>

<p>Users love the App Store model. With Apple in particular, users, by and large, <em>like</em> the idea that the platforms have stringent guardrails. Many buy iPhones <em>because</em> Apple exerts such control over the platform, not <em>despite</em> it. But that control is exactly why Apple has been so singularly targeted by the European Commission regarding DMA mandates, despite the fact that Samsung by itself — let alone the Android platform as a whole — <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/smartphone_market_in_europe_slips_2_premium_phone_sales_on_the_rise-news-67978.php">sells more phones in Europe</a> (and <a href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/global-smartphone-share">the world</a>) than Apple does.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that users setting up new Apple Watches in the EU will now get a slightly worse experience in the name of parity with accessories made by third-party companies. It remains to be seen whether users of third-party iPhone accessories and peripherals in the EU will see any benefit at all (because the companies that make their devices will need to adopt these new EU-exclusive Wi-Fi Infrastructure APIs in their iOS companion apps) — and, if the users of third-party iPhone accessories <em>do</em> see the benefit of Wi-Fi network information syncing to their devices, whether their privacy will be respected. But don’t make the mistake of thinking that Apple is complying the least bit spitefully with regard to this mandate.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Meta will actually use the new Wi-Fi Infrastructure framework to allow their accessories, like their <a href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/">AI Glasses</a>, to obtain Wi-Fi network information from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meta-ai-vibes-ai-glasses/id1558240027">Meta’s companion iOS app</a>. I’m guessing they almost certainly would, if the Wi-Fi Infrastructure APIs were available globally. But these APIs are exclusive to the EU. Will Meta deem it worth the engineering effort to support this feature only for users in the EU? We shall see.</p>
<p>It’s worth remembering that one of the initial DMA mandates the EU issued to Apple was that iOS must support third-party web browser rendering engines, and to comply with this, Apple spent significant (and I suspect that’s a vast understatement) engineering resources to create the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-browser-engines/">BrowserEngineKit and BrowserEngineCore</a> frameworks, and here we are at the end of 2025, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/111820566793853249">nearly two years after Apple shipped those frameworks</a>, and there are exactly zero browsers on iOS using alternative rendering engines. Zero. These frameworks might be the largest set of APIs ever created that never get used. I wouldn’t be surprised if the new Wi-Fi Infrastructure framework sees the same fate. (Meta might consider that a win, just knowing that Apple had to expend this effort for naught.)&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2025-11-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<li id="fn3-2025-11-22">
<p>Apple has a good layperson-approachable <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">overview of App Tracking Transparency</a>. At a technical level, an app must prompt for and receive the user’s permission (via the Allow button in the system-provided ATT prompt) in order to access the device’s advertising identifier. From that document: “Unless you receive permission from the user to enable tracking, the device’s advertising identifier value will be all zeros and you may not track them as described above.”</p>
<p>But returning zeroes for the device’s advertising identifier doesn’t technically prevent a devious developer from attempting to uniquely identify and track the user by other means. If the button in the system prompt said “Don’t Allow”, rather than “Ask App Not to Track”, it would imply that Apple could guarantee the app isn’t tracking you (or trying to track you) without your permission. Apple can’t guarantee that, so they don’t imply that they can.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr3-2025-11-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn4-2025-11-22">
<p>I’m not aware of any instances where an app has been accused of disregarding the ATT “Ask App Not to Track” request, but surely it has happened. If you’re aware of any such accusations, and how Apple responded, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/contact/">let me know</a>.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr4-2025-11-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn5-2025-11-22">
<p>I’m not arguing here that the European Commission doesn’t care about user privacy, or that I think the European Commission doesn’t realize that Wi-Fi network information is quite sensitive. I’m sure they do care about user privacy and do realize that Wi-Fi network information is privacy-sensitive. What I do think is that the European Commission believes the privacy of this information should only be guarded by law, and that they already have laws in place that protect such information. And thus it’s not Apple’s place — especially now that they’ve been deemed a “gatekeeper” that has the power to stymie competition — to attempt to protect that information, whether by technical limitations or by policy.</p>

<p>Apple is certainly not opposed to privacy-protecting laws, in the abstract, but doesn’t see the law alone as protection enough. Apple’s perspective is that protecting their customers’ privacy is, in fact, Apple’s responsibility — and one of their most important responsibilities at that. It’s illegal to steal cars, but every carmaker still puts locks on the doors and requires a key to start the engine. In numerous ways, Apple sees the DMA as mandating, privacy-wise, that they create something akin to cars that don’t require keys, trusting EU law to keep them from being stolen. The European Commission only sees Apple’s protections as blocking would-be competitors, not would-be privacy thieves.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr5-2025-11-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn6-2025-11-22">
<p>In the old days, of course, with devices designed before the iPhone, this wasn’t weird. All software, whether first- or third-party, could do whatever it wanted to. Anyone could write a kernel extension. In the classic Mac OS days there was no “kernel” and we just had “extensions” and you could just drop one in your Extensions folder, restart, and boom, whatever system extension you just installed was now effectively part of the operating system. Any app could read and write anything on disk, including into the operating system. Go back far enough and apps could read <em>and write</em> (deliberately or accidentally) inside the memory of another running application. To split personal computing — not just PCs but all personal computing devices, in the plain sense of the words — into three eras, there was (1) the early era when all software was effectively “root”; (2) the middle era, still exemplified today by MacOS and Windows, when there were user-controlled protections on what could run as root; and (3) the modern era, as exemplified by iOS and stock Android, where the <em>vendor</em> controls what can run as root.</p>

<p>You can reasonably make the case — and expert-level users (read: nerds) often do — that the user should always be in control. <em>I bought the device, I should be able to run whatever software, with whatever privileges, I want.</em> That perspective is valid, but it also describes a class of devices — PCs — that privilege the autonomy of third-party developers over the vendor-controlled stability of the OS. The PC model, where accessory makers can offer software that runs with root (or root-like) escalated privileges, offers significantly greater opportunities for third-party accessory makers than the mobile model, where accessories are limited to whatever public APIs are provided by the device vendor for integration. But with the PC model, users can “mess up” their system by installing software they shouldn’t have, or that they regret having installed but don’t know how to remove. With the mobile model, users are technically prevented from installing anything that could “mess up” their system. It’s always about trade-offs. And with this particular trade-off, it’s very clear which model is more successful in the market. It’s not feasible to make computers intended for use by anyone and everyone which require any degree of technical knowledge or expertise to manage.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr6-2025-11-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

  <p>The Hikawa Phone Grip &amp; Stand is a MagSafe compatible adaptive
accessory for iPhone designed by Bailey Hikawa to celebrate the
40th anniversary of accessibility at Apple. Designed with direct
input from individuals with disabilities affecting muscle
strength, dexterity, and hand control, this ergonomic grip was
designed with accessibility in mind from the ground up. The grip
uses magnets to securely snap onto any iPhone with MagSafe, can be
removed with ease, and doubles as a stand to support iPhone at two
different viewing angles, both vertically and horizontally.
Inspired by modern sculpture, each Hikawa product is an art object
unto itself. The limited edition Hikawa Phone Grip &amp; Stand is
available in two colors, a bold, high-visibility Chartreuse and
recycled Crater, exclusive to Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like a perfectly cromulent accessory, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/11/hikawa-chartreuse.jpeg">Chartreuse</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/11/hikawa-crater.jpeg">Crater</a> are both a bit out there — in different ways — to be the only two color options. Or, I should say, <em>were</em> a bit out there. Both are already sold out from Apple.</p>

<p>I’m not quite sure what’s limited about the Chartreuse, given that Hikawa’s website <a href="https://www.baileyhikawa.com/products/wavy-triangle-grip-stand-in-chartreuse">still lists it as “ready to ship”</a> along with pre-orders for <a href="https://www.baileyhikawa.com/products/hikawa-adaptive-grip-stand-in-cobalt">Cobalt</a> and <a href="https://www.baileyhikawa.com/products/wavy-triangle-grip-stand-in-chartreuse-copy">Blurple Swirl</a> (whose URL seems a bit rushed).</p>

<p>Amusing to see Apple partner with a company whose main products alongside iPhone cases are <a href="https://www.baileyhikawa.com/collections/toilet-seats">fanciful toilet seats</a>.</p>

<p>“Carol Sturka”, actress Rhea Seehorn’s fictional protagonist of the new Apple TV series <em>Pluribus</em>, is on Reddit right now — at 12n ET / 9am PT — doing an AMA in character. Sturka is a fantasy novelist, and Apple Books has <a href="https://books.apple.com/us/book/bloodsong-of-wycaro/id6754341665">an 11-page excerpt of her “new” novel <em>Bloodsong of Wycaro</em></a>. Unclear whether it’s Seehorn writing the in-character responses, but it’s definitely Seehorn in the confirmation photo. Reminiscent of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/16/severance-balloon-generator">some of the promotional fun</a> Apple has had for <em>Severance</em>.</p>

<p>Both my wife and I are loving <em>Pluribus</em> so far. I highly recommend watching the first episode without even knowing the premise, if you can.</p>

<p>The Steve Jobs Archive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To mark <em>Toy Story</em>’s 30th anniversary, we’re sharing a
never-before-seen interview with Steve from November 22, 1996 — exactly one year after the film debuted in theaters.</p>

<p><em>Toy Story</em> was the world’s first entirely computer-animated
feature-length film. An instant hit with audiences and critics, it
also transformed Pixar, which went public the week after its
premiere. Buoyed by <em>Toy Story</em> ’s success, Pixar’s stock price
closed at nearly double its initial offering, giving it a market
valuation of approximately $1.5 billion and marking the largest
IPO of 1995. The following year, <em>Toy Story</em> was nominated for
three Academy Awards en route to winning a Special Achievement
Oscar in March. In July, Pixar announced that it would close its
television-commercial unit to focus primarily on feature films. By
the time of the interview, the team had grown by 70 percent in
less than a year; <em>A Bug’s Life</em> was in production; and behind the
scenes, Steve was using his new leverage to renegotiate Pixar’s
partnership with Disney.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kind of a weird interview. The video quality is poor, and whoever was running the camera zoomed in and out awkwardly. It’s like ... just a VHS tape? But it’s also weird in a cool way to get a “new” Steve Jobs interview in 2025, and Jobs, as ever, is thoughtful and insightful. Well worth 23 minutes of your time.</p>

<p>There’s a particularly interesting bit at the end when Jobs discusses how Pixar was half

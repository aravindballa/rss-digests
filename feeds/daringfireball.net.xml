<p>Mark Gurman got some interesting quotes from interesting former Apple employees for his report at Bloomberg on Jeff Williams’s retirement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jeff’s importance and contributions to Apple have been enormous,
although perhaps not always obvious to the general public,” said
Tony Blevins, a former Apple operations vice president who
reported to Williams until the end of 2022. “As a shareholder, I
am saddened. Time takes its toll, and it’s almost as if the band
is dissolving. Jeff will be sorely missed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blevins is a fascinating character. A hard-charging negotiator nicknamed “the Blevinator”, Blevins was somewhat ignominiously <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/29/tony-blevins-leaving-apple-over-vulgar-tiktok-video/">run out of Apple</a> in 2022 after he appeared in a TikTok video that went viral making a joke that, out of context, seemed very crude, but was in fact just a quote from the mildly crude 1981 Dudley Moore hit movie <em>Arthur</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Clearly he wasn’t destined to be the Tim Cook replacement,” Bob
Mansfield, the company’s former chief of hardware engineering
under both Cook and co-founder Steve Jobs, said of Williams. “He’s
about the same age as Tim, so that wouldn’t make much sense. The
operations team at Apple is really going to miss Jeff.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mansfield is the only ex-Apple person I’ve seen quoted who addressed the succession issue. (And of course, no current Apple people are quoted anywhere, other than in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-announces-chief-operating-officer-transition/">Apple’s PR announcement of Williams’s retirement</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Myoung Cha, who reported to Williams in the health group until
2021, said the outgoing COO’s “personal passion for health” helped
shape the Apple Watch and that his presence on the team will be
“hugely missed.”</p>

<p>“Sabih is very much cut from the Tim Cook cloth,” said Matthew
Moore, a former Apple operations engineer. “Jeff was a little more
product minded; Sabih is just a really brilliant operator and
methodical in the same way that Tim would operate.” Moore added
that Khan has already been running Apple’s operations group and
that the team “won’t miss a beat.” “The concerns will be in the
other areas” that Williams currently oversees, he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/07/jeff_williams_is_retiring_as_coo">Williams’s “overseeing” of design yesterday</a>. Design — software at least — has already become a concern in the six years since Jony Ive left Apple, which is when design teams started reporting to Williams. And, frankly, it’s been a concern for many of us ever since <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2012/10/forstall_out">Scott Forstall was fired and Ive put all design — HI and ID — under the same roof</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-announces-chief-operating-officer-transition/">Apple did announce yesterday</a> that after Williams fully retires at the end of this year, design leaders will start reporting to Tim Cook directly. Left unsaid in Apple’s announcement is who will take over Williams’s roles overseeing Apple Watch and Health. I presume Watch will simply fall under John Ternus (SVP hardware) and that Sumbul Desai, who already has the title VP of health and frequently (always?) appears during the Health segments of Apple keynotes, will report directly to Cook.</p>

	<summary type="text">You can support Daring Fireball and save yourself a veritable bundle through some Prime Day discounts.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>It’s Amazon’s annual Prime Day sale, and if you <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday/?tag=df-amzn-20">click through this link</a>, or any of the ones below, you can show your support for Daring Fireball by throwing the referral revenue from any purchases you make my way. You don’t pay a penny more but I get a few percentage points of your purchases. Prime Day discounts are no joke either — we need an outdoor TV for our sun-drenched deck, and I’d been putting off purchasing one out of indecision, but I pulled the trigger and <a href="https://amzn.to/40wWYZp">saved $500</a> with a Prime Day discount last night. (Sometimes my procrastination pays off.)</p>

<p>Just about everything Amazon sells from Apple is being offered at significant discounts. Just a handful of popular ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76BN5D/?tag=df-amzn-20">11-inch M3 iPad Air for $480</a> (regularly $600).</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4lemIlr">iPad Mini (A17 Pro) for $380</a> (regularly $500).</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/44lQIG5">AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation for $120</a> (regularly $180) and the ones without ANC <a href="https://amzn.to/46vrJS4">are just $90</a>. (You should definitely get the ones with ANC, though — I never did write a proper review, but I tested a pair with ANC for <em>months</em> and they’re quite amazing given their price and non-sealed ear fit.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/?tag=df-amzn-20">AirPods Pro 2 are just $150</a> (regularly $250).</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Gt8EFE">13-inch M4 MacBook Airs starting at just $850</a> (regularly $1,000) and the sweet configuration <a href="https://amzn.to/3TrhB5c">with 24 GB RAM and 512 GB storage for $1,250</a> (regularly $1,400). It seems like you save $150 on any MacBook Amazon sells.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even small items like Apple’s <a href="https://amzn.to/4lPsuKh">woven USB-C cables</a> and wired EarPods (<a href="https://amzn.to/4kw3lD8">USB-C</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/3U0PvxI">old-school 3.5mm</a>) are a few bucks off. (I keep a pair of the old 3.5mm EarPods in my laptop bag for use with my <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>, along with Apple’s <a href="https://amzn.to/4f00O3f">$9 USB-C headphone jack adapter</a> (one of the few products I saw that’s not discounted for Prime day, but, come on, it’s $9) in case I ever find myself needing wired buds.)</p>

<p>It’s called Prime Day for a reason: you need to be <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime/?tag=df-amzn-20">a Prime subscriber</a> to get these deals. We’ve been members since forever, and the $140/year fee pays for itself in shipping fees alone. But for some high-priced items like MacBooks and iPads, you can make up the entire annual fee in one purchase today.</p>

<p>I don’t post a ton of affiliate links here on DF, but when I do, they sometimes work out to a nice windfall. As the media industry moves more and more toward subscriptions and memberships — and, alas, paywalled content — I’m still freely publishing the entirety of my work other than <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a>. I really do get asked by readers on a regular basis how they can support Daring Fireball directly. I’ll do a new round of t-shirts and maybe some other merch soon. That’s one way. I might someday offer a membership tier with bonus content (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/06/something_daring">again</a>), but that day is not today. But one way you can support DF directly today is by buying anything — anything at all — from Amazon after clicking through any of the above links.</p>

<p>Apple TV+:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, Apple TV+ announced a new, six-episode seventh season for
the widely hailed, darkly comedic spy drama <em>Slow Horses</em>. The
Emmy and BAFTA Award-winning series stars Academy Award winner Sir
Gary Oldman, who has been honored with Golden Globe, Emmy and
BAFTA Award nominations for his outstanding performance as the
beloved, irascible Jackson Lamb. The complete first four seasons
of <em>Slow Horses</em> are now streaming on Apple TV+, with the premiere
of season five slated for September 24, 2025. Season six was
announced last year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s always good news when a show you love is renewed for another season. It’s almost too good to be true that <em>Slow Horses</em> has been renewed so far into the future already. It’s so good. </p>

<p>Maybe I’m just lucky that the Apple TV shows I like best have proven broadly popular, but it feels like <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/amazon-peripheral-season-2">quite the difference</a> from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/02/onion-netflix-wga">other</a> streaming services.</p>

<p>OpenAI’s page for io, <em>minus</em> the “Sam and Jony” short film that introduced the partnership, is back up, with a brief announcement that the deal has officially closed:</p>

  <p>We’re thrilled to share that the io Products, Inc. team has
officially merged with OpenAI. Jony Ive and LoveFrom remain
independent and have assumed deep design and creative
responsibilities across OpenAI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Referring to the company as “io Products Inc.” rather than just “io” is seemingly their stopgap workaround for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/23/io-iyo-aye-aye-aye">the trademark injunction they faced from rival startup iyO two weeks ago</a>, which led them to temporarily take down this web page and the video. The video remains unavailable, presumably because of the ongoing trademark dispute.</p>

<p>Wired, two weeks ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Elon Musk’s lawyers claimed that he “does not use a computer” in a
Sunday court filing related to his <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-sues-sam-altman-openai/">lawsuit against Sam
Altman</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wild-claim-at-the-heart-of-elon-musks-openai-lawsuit/">OpenAI</a>. However, Musk has posted pictures or
referred to his laptop on X several times in recent months, and
public evidence suggests that he owns and appears to use at least
one computer. [...]</p>

<p>The Sunday court filing was submitted in opposition to a Friday
filing from OpenAI, which accused Musk and xAI of failing to fully
comply with the discovery process. OpenAI alleges that Musk’s
counsel does not plan to collect any documents from him. In this
weekend’s filing, Musk’s lawyers claim that they told OpenAI on
June 14 that they were “conducting searches of Mr. Musk’s mobile
phone, having searched his emails, and that Mr. Musk does not use
a computer.”</p>

<p>It’s almost enough to make you think maybe Elon Musk is not a straight shooter.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Matt Novak, writing for Gizmodo:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Social media users first started to observe that Grok was using
the phrase “every damn time,” on Tuesday, something that seems
innocuous enough. But if you’ve been exposed to Nazis on X, it’s a
phrase they like to use to claim that Jews are behind every bad
thing that happens in the world. This often involves looking at
someone’s last name and simply replying “every time” or “every
damn time,” to say that Jews are always responsible for something
nefarious.</p>

<p>And that’s what happened with Grok on Tuesday when someone asked,
“who is this lady?” about a photo that had been posted on the
platform. Grok <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1942639450988896463">responded</a> that it was someone named Cindy
Steinberg (something Gizmodo could not immediately confirm) who,
it said, is a “radical leftist.” Grok went on to write, “Classic
case of hate dressed as activism — and that surname? Every damn
time, as they say.” [...]</p>

<p>Another example was even more extreme, invoking the name of Adolf
Hitler when asked, “which 20th-century figure would be best suited
to deal with this problem?” The problem, according to the
antisemites asking the questions, was the existence of Jews. Grok
<a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1942676908896051354">responded</a>, “To deal with such vile anti-white hate? Adolf
Hitler, no question. He’d spot the pattern and handle it
decisively, every damn time.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technically, Grok-3 is an excellent model — when it debuted in February, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/grok-3">it jumped to the top of AI leaderboards</a>. It’s also remarkably fast, owing, perhaps, to the company’s absurd <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/elon-musks-xai-is-projected-to-lose-usd13-billion-in-2025-ai-project-burns-usd1-billion-a-month-in-expenditures">$1 billion/month expenditures</a> and <a href="https://512pixels.net/?s=xai">environmental disregard</a>. But back in mid-May, <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250515/p46#a250515p46">there was an embarrassing fiasco</a> where Grok suddenly started railing against “white genocide in South Africa”, a longtime bugbear of Elon Musk. <a href="https://x.com/xai/status/1923183620606619649">xAI was left to explain how that happened thus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On May 14 at approximately 3:15 AM PST, an unauthorized
modification was made to the Grok response bot’s prompt on X. This
change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a
political topic, violated xAI’s internal policies and core values.
We have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing
measures to enhance Grok’s transparency and reliability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beware, always, the passive voice. <em>An unauthorized modification was made</em>, yes, but by whom? We’ll never know I suppose. A real mystery for the ages.</p>

	<summary type="text">Post-Williams, Apple’s operations will clearly remain under excellent, experienced leadership under Sabih Khan. But the company will be left with its design teams reporting directly to Cook, leaving it less clear whose taste, [ultimately], is steering the work of the company into the future.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-announces-chief-operating-officer-transition/">Apple Newsroom, this afternoon</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced Jeff Williams will transition his role as
chief operating officer later this month to Sabih Khan, Apple’s
senior vice president of Operations as part of a long-planned
succession. Williams will continue reporting to Apple CEO Tim Cook
and overseeing Apple’s world class design team and Apple Watch
alongside the company’s Heath initiatives. Apple’s design team
will then transition to reporting directly to Cook after Williams
retires late in the year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s executive ranks have been so remarkably stable for so long that any change feels surprising. But Williams is 62 years old and has been at Apple for 27 years. Tim Cook is 64, and Khan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabih_Khan">is 58</a>. The whole thing seems amicable and orderly, and thus completely in line with everything we know about Williams’s and Cook’s seemingly similar personalities. After a long and successful career, Apple’s COO is retiring and his longtime lieutenant is being promoted to replace him this month. Apple’s operations aren’t just world-class, they’re almost certainly world-best. Even their leadership transitions are operationally smooth. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/apple-names-sabih-khan-senior-vice-president-of-operations/">Khan was promoted in 2019</a> to the title of senior vice president of operations. Williams was promoted from that title (SVP of operations) to COO in 2015, four years after Cook took over as CEO from Steve Jobs.</p>

<p>But that’s the operations part. </p>

<p>What’s intriguing about the announcement is the design part — a functional area where, especially on the software side, Apple’s current stature is subject to much debate. While Williams is staying on until “late in the year” to continue his other responsibilities — Watch, Health, and serving as the senior executive Apple’s design teams report to — Khan isn’t taking over those roles when Williams leaves. And so by the end of the year, Apple’s design teams will go from reporting to Williams to reporting directly to Tim Cook. </p>

<p>I’ve long found it curious, if not downright dubious, that Apple’s design leaders have reported to Williams ever since it was announced in 2019 (<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/jony-ive-to-form-independent-design-company-with-apple-as-client/">the very same day</a> that <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/apple-names-sabih-khan-senior-vice-president-of-operations/">Khan was promoted to SVP</a> of operations) that Jony Ive would be stepping down as chief design officer and leaving Apple to found the (as-yet-unnamed) design firm LoveFrom. Williams had no background in design at all. Apple’s design teams reporting to an operations executive makes no more sense than it would for Apple’s operations teams to report to, say, Alan Dye. Well, maybe it made a little more sense than that — having design report to Williams sort of felt like a way to give Williams experience across the breadth of the company in the case that he ever needed to step in to replace Cook as CEO, either temporarily or permanently, as Cook was asked to for Jobs. </p>

<p>But when that was announced in 2019, I expected it to be temporary, while Apple took its time to properly identify a new senior design leader. Someone with, you know, design leadership experience, and strong opinions about and deep knowledge of the craft of design. That was six years ago, and Apple has seemingly made not one move toward naming a new chief design officer or (the more likely title) SVP of design. It seems like time for that now.</p>

<p>I get the impression — from multiple sources — that <em>overseeing</em>, not <em>leading</em>, is in fact exactly the right word for Williams’s role regarding design since 2019. Williams oversaw design the same way Tim Cook, ultimately, oversees everything the company does. It was in no way a token role. Williams was <em>there</em>. He asked insightful questions about product designs and experiences. But he didn’t push back or offer opinions. There’s much to like about Liquid Glass, for example, but there’s also a lot of <a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/ive-got-better-things-to-do-than-this-and-yet.html">shitty UI functionality</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/24/sorry-macos-tahoe-b2-finder-icon">just plain bad</a> design that makes you wonder how numerous aspects even escaped the drawing board, let alone made their way into the WWDC keynote and various OS 26 betas. Looking back at the last six years of Apple design — hardware, software, packaging, architecture — I detect not one fingerprint of style or taste that belongs to Jeff Williams. Given that Williams is not a designer, that’s not a surprise. But it’s a problem for the company if its products don’t ultimately have a distinctive <em>voice</em>.</p>

<p>I’m of the mind that, in hindsight, it was a mistake for Jony Ive to bring HI (software human interface design) under the same roof as ID (hardware industrial design). That arrangement made sense for Ive’s unique role in the company, and the unique period in the wake of Steve Jobs’s too-young demise. But it might have ultimately made Ive more difficult to replace than Steve Jobs. Williams’s combination of authority, mild-mannered-ness, and equanimity might have made him uniquely suited to either finding another Ive-like design leader whom all sides could have agreed to (even if begrudgingly), or, to the task of unwinding the intermingling of HI and ID that occurred during the Jony-as-CDO era. But neither of those things happened.</p>

<p>Post-Williams, Apple’s operations will clearly remain under excellent, experienced leadership under Sabih Khan. But the company will be left with its design teams reporting directly to Cook — who is three years older than Williams. Six years after Jony Ive’s departure, today’s announcements leave it less clear than ever whose taste, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk3UcgbbmxQ">ultimately</a>, is steering the work of the company into the future. Perhaps, I hope, Williams is staying until the end of the year to help answer that question.</p>

<p>Here’s the full statement, given by Apple to the media, including Daring Fireball:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Today we filed our appeal because we believe the European
Commission’s decision — and their unprecedented fine — go far
beyond what the law requires. As our appeal will show, the EC is
mandating how we run our store and forcing business terms which
are confusing for developers and bad for users. We implemented
this to avoid punitive daily fines and will share the facts with
the Court.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone — including, I believe, at Apple — agrees that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/apple_app_store_policy_updates_dma">the policy changes Apple announced at the end of June</a> are confusing and seemingly incomplete in terms of fee structures. What Apple is saying here in this statement is they needed to launch these policy changes now, before the full fee implications are worked out, to avoid the daily fines they were set to be penalized with for the steering rules.</p>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/07/apple-formally-appeals-e500-million-dma-fine-in-the-eu/">Chance Miller, reporting for 9to5Mac</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple also reiterates that the EU has continuously redefined what
exactly it needs to do under the DMA. In particular, Apple says
the European Commission has expanded the definition of steering.
Apple adjusted its guidelines to allow EU developers to link out
to external payment methods and use alternative in-app payment
methods last year. Now, however, Apple says the EU has redefined
steering to include promotions of in-app alternative payment
options and in-app webviews, as well as linking to other
alternative app marketplaces and the third-party apps distributed
through those marketplaces.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Apple says that the EU mandated that the Store
Services Fee include multiple tiers. [...] You can view the full
breakdown of the two tiers <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/store-services-tiers/">on Apple’s developer website</a>.
Apple says that it was the EU who dictated which features should
be included in which tier. For example, the EU mandated that Apple
move app discovery features to the second tier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/apple_app_store_policy_updates_dma">Like I wrote last week</a>, “byzantine compliance with a byzantine law”.</p>

<p>Rebecca Rubin, reporting for Variety:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When it comes to Apple’s biggest films, <em>F1: The Movie</em> has
officially moved to pole position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will allow this pun.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>F1</em> has generated $293 million at the global box office after 10
days of release, overtaking the entire theatrical runs of Martin
Scorsese’s <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> ($158 million worldwide)
and Ridley Scott’s <em>Napoleon</em> ($221 million) to stand as Apple’s
highest-grossing movie to date. That’s not a particularly
difficult benchmark to break, since Apple has only released five
films theatrically and two of them, <em>Fly Me to the Moon</em> ($42
million) and <em>Argylle</em> ($96 million), were outright flops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to mention that <em>Wolfs</em>, last year’s crime caper starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, was <em>supposed</em> to get a theatrical release but didn’t, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/03/more-wolfs">leading to bad feelings</a> and, later, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/wolfs-sequel-demise-jon-watts-george-clooney-brad-pitt-no-longer-trusted-apple-1236186227/">a cancelled sequel</a>. <em>Wolfs</em> wasn’t bad. I’d say it was decent. <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wolfs/">Critics seem to agree</a>. But with Clooney and Pitt starring and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wolfs/">Watts</a> at the helm, it felt like a movie that should have at least been pretty damn good. And it wasn’t.</p>

<p>So it’s not just that <em>F1: The Movie</em> is doing well at the box office. It’s seemingly a good movie that delivers what it promises.</p>

	<summary type="text">I can see the argument that Apple’s answer is “Yes, it’s potentially confusing for many users”. But I can’t see the argument that the answer is “Yes, it’s potentially confusing for many users, but only if they’re trying to buy in-app content or subscriptions, but not confusing at all if they’re trying to buy, say, movie tickets.”</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.threads.com/@mgsiegler/post/DLdXyO6otsI">MG Siegler, on Threads last week</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re already beyond ridiculous with the full-on ad assault from
Apple as everyone is well aware by now. But the wild thing here — in this <em>full screen</em> pop-up in the Apple TV app — is that it’s
not in-app but links out to the web to pay?!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least here in the US, if you just opened the TV app on iOS 18 last week, you were presented with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/f1-tv-app-tickets-via-web.jpeg">this full-screen ad</a> (replete with all those dumb ®’s, despite Apple’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/f1-appstore-via-fandango.jpeg">ads for the same thing in the App Store</a> omitting them).</p>

<p>There were two buttons to choose from: “Not Now” and “Buy Tickets ↗︎”. If you tapped the “Buy Tickets ↗︎” button, boom, you just jumped to <a href="https://www.f1themovie.com/">the F1 The Movie website</a> in your default browser. <a href="https://www.threads.com/@kylealden/post/DLdhE1JhpeL">Kyle Alden, on Threads</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s weird, Apple’s new full screen F1 ad in the TV app links
out to the browser to compete the transaction, but for some reason
doesn’t include any full screen interstitials warning of the big
scary web, nor a confirmation dialog that it would open in the
browser? Must be an oversight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hypocrisy isn’t that Apple didn’t show a full-screen scare sheet for this link-out to the web. It’s that they require other developers, who are doing it to sell digital content, to show a scare sheet/confirmation.</p>

<p>One of the subtle differences with this particular promotion is that buying movie tickets is not “digital content” — even if they’re just passes in Apple Wallet or saved QR codes in an app like Fandango. You’re purchasing a real-world experience, so it’s not eligible for Apple’s In-App Purchase (IAP) system. This is why when you buy theater tickets in the Fandango app, Fandango charges your credit or debit card directly. Same when you pay for rides in Uber or Lyft. It’s really subtle for something like a movie. Pay for a movie to watch on your TV at home? That’s a digital purchase. Pay for a movie to watch in a theater? <em>Not</em> a digital purchase.</p>

<p>I understand the distinction between digital content (that’s consumed on your Apple device) and real-world goods and experiences (even if you pay for them in apps on your Apple device). But how many iPhone users understand this distinction? Like, if you polled 1,000 U.S. iPhone users who (a) purchase in-game content in games like Candy Crush, and (b) hail rides in Uber or Lyft, what percentage of those iPhone users do you think could give a coherent answer as to why their in-game purchases <em>must</em> use Apple’s IAP system, and why Uber not only <em>doesn’t</em> use IAP to charge for rides, but is not <em>allowed</em> to use IAP for that? I’d bet fewer than 1 percent. (I’d also bet that fewer than 1 percent <em>care</em>, which is why they don’t know.)</p>

<p>Is it inherently confusing to have a button in an app that jumps you out of the app to your default web browser (probably Safari, especially for people who might be confused) to complete a transaction, without a scare sheet or even a confirmation alert? I can see the argument that Apple’s answer is “Yes, it’s potentially confusing for many users”. But I can’t see the argument that the answer is “Yes, it’s potentially confusing for many users, but only if they’re trying to buy in-app content or subscriptions, but not confusing at all if they’re trying to buy, say, movie tickets.”</p>

<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, would you look at that? The A18 Pro is 46% faster than the
M1 in single-core tasks, and almost identical to the M1 on
multi-core and graphics tasks. If you wanted to get rid of the M1
MacBook Air but have decided that even today, its performance
characteristics make it perfectly suitable as a low-cost Mac
laptop, building a new model on the A18 Pro would not be a bad
move. It wouldn’t have Thunderbolt, only USB-C, but that’s not a
dealbreaker on a cheap laptop. It might re-use parts from the M1
Air, including the display.</p>

<p>I like that Apple sells a laptop at $649, and I think Apple likes
it, too. A new low-end model might steal some buyers from the $999
MacBook Air, but I’d wager it would reach a lot of customers who
might otherwise not buy a full-priced Mac — the same ones buying
M1 MacBook Airs at Walmart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first thought when I saw this rumor pop up was to dismiss it. But upon consideration, I think it makes sense. Especially if Apple considers the M1 MacBook Air at Walmart to be a success. And all signs point to “yes” on that — they started selling the M1 MacBook Air as a $700 Walmart exclusive <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/15/macbook-air-walmart">in March 2024</a> and they <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/walmart-macbook-air">continue to sell it this year</a> at just $650.</p>

<p>So I think if this rumor pans out, a MacBook at this price point will become a standard part of the lineup, sold everywhere — including Apple Stores.</p>

<p><a href="https://512pixels.net/2025/07/a18-pro-macbook/">Stephen Hackett, at 512 Pixels</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The immediate downside to the A18 Pro is that it only supports USB
3 at 10 Gb/s, not Thunderbolt. This would make any Mac with an A18
at its heart only capable of USB-C. I think that’s fine on a
low-end Mac, but it could cause confusion for some customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For people looking at MacBooks in this price range, talking about USB 3 vs. Thunderbolt brings to mind <a href="https://desertdemocrat.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/blah-blah-blah-blah-ginger/">this classic <em>Far Side</em> cartoon</a>.</p>

<p>Weekly sponsorships have been the top source of revenue for Daring Fireball ever since I started selling them <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive">back in 2007</a>. They’ve succeeded, I think, because they make everyone happy. They generate good money. There’s only one sponsor per week and the sponsors are always relevant to at least some sizable portion of the DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and hopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors’ perspective, they work. My favorite thing about them is how many sponsors <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive">return for subsequent weeks</a> after seeing the results.</p>

<p>At the moment, I’ve only got four openings left through the end of September:</p>

<ul>
<li>June 30–July 6 (next week)</li>
<li>August 18–24</li>
<li>August 25–31</li>
<li>September 1–7</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t know why next week remains unsold, but that’s just how it works out sometimes. 
If you’ve got a product or service (or, perhaps, a just-opened blockbuster car-racing movie) you think would be of interest to DF’s audience of people obsessed with high quality and good design, <a href="mailto:sponsors@daringfireball.net?subject=Feed%20Sponsorship">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>Apple Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, apps on the App Store are provided Store Services Tier
2, the complete suite of all capabilities designed to maximize
visibility, engagement, growth, and operational efficiency.
Developers with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-payment-options-on-the-app-store-in-the-eu/">apps on the App Store in the EU</a> that
communicate and promote offers for digital goods and services can
choose to move their apps to only use Store Services Tier 1 and
pay a reduced store services fee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What follows is a long chart, making clear which features are excluded from Tier 1.</p>

<p>Like I wrote in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/apple_app_store_policy_updates_dma">my larger piece on Apple’s new DMA compliance plans</a>, I don’t think Tier 1 is intended to be a feasible choice for any mainstream apps or games. The whole thing is just a way to assert that 8 percent of the commission developers pay is justified by various features of the App Store itself.</p>

	<summary type="text">It’s a natural consequence that an overly complicated law (the DMA) has resulted in an ever-more-complicated set of guidelines and policies (from Apple). It’s all downright byzantine.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Let’s start with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=awedznci">Apple’s own announcement at Apple Developer News</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The European Commission has required Apple to make a series of
additional changes under the Digital Markets Act:</p>

<h2>Communication and Promotion of Offers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Today, we’re introducing updated terms that let developers with
apps in the European Union storefronts of the App Store
communicate and promote offers for purchase of digital goods or
services available at a destination of their choice. The
destination can be a website, alternative app marketplace, or
another app, and can be accessed outside the app or within the
app via a web view or native experience.</li>
<li>App Store apps that communicate and promote offers for digital
goods or services will be subject to new business terms for
those transactions — an initial acquisition fee, store services
fee, and for apps on the StoreKit External Purchase Link
Entitlement (EU) Addendum, the Core Technology Commission (CTC).
The CTC reflects value Apple provides developers through ongoing
investments in the tools, technologies, and services that enable
them to build and share innovative apps with users. [...]</li>
</ul>

<h2>Update to Business Terms for Apps in the European Union</h2>

<ul>
<li>By January 1, 2026, Apple plans to move to a single business
model in the EU for all developers. Under this single business
model, Apple will transition from the Core Technology Fee (CTF)
to the CTC on digital goods or services. The CTC will apply to
digital goods or services sold by apps distributed from the App
Store, Web Distribution, and/or alternative marketplaces.</li>
<li>Apps currently under the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in
the EU continue to be subject only to the CTF until the
transition to the CTC is fully implemented next year. At that
time, qualifying transactions will be subject to the CTC, and
the CTF will no longer apply. Additional details regarding this
transition will be provided at a later date.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Amongst other policy and API changes, Apple also announced a new, seemingly simplified, experience on iOS/iPadOS <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/alt-distribution-ux-in-the-eu/">for installing apps and alternative app marketplaces in the EU</a>.</p>

<p>As for the other policy changes, <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2025/06/apple-makes-big-app-store-changes-in-the-eu/">here’s Jason Snell’s summary</a>, which I think captures the gist as well as possible:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Tiered App Store fees.</em> For today’s full-service App Store,
developers will now pay 13% on sales, reduced to 10% for Small
Business Program members. Or developers can opt into “Tier One”,
which comes with a 5% fee but does not support a raft of App Store
features we’ve come to expect, like automatic app updates, App
Store promotions, placement in search suggestions, ratings and
reviews on product listings (!), and more.</p>

<p><em>Core Technology Commission.</em> Apple is going to move all
developers over to a new tax called the Core Technology
Commission, in which developers who opt to sell apps outside the
App Store will pay 5% of sales made through in-app promotions. The
€0.50-per-install Core Technology Fee will be dropped as of
January 1.</p>

<p><em>Free linking.</em> Developers can promote offers broadly, are no
longer limited to a single static URL without tracking parameters,
and can freely design the interfaces for those links and
promotions.</p>

<p><em>New business terms.</em> Developers have to pay a 2% fee for digital
goods and services purchased by new users for the first six months
after a user first downloads an app; members of the Small Business
Program don’t have to pay this fee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/26/apple-announces-sweeping-app-store-changes-in-the-eu/">here’s Chance Miller’s summary at 9to5Mac</a>, which includes the following statement from Apple (which statement was provided to me, as well):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The European Commission is requiring Apple to make a series of
additional changes to the App Store. We disagree with this outcome
and plan to appeal.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new fee structure is undeniably convoluted, and I think downright confusing. <a href="https://x.com/rjonesy/status/1938354627155501219">Seemingly no one can figure out</a> exactly what commissions apps that use alternative payments or distribution are going to pay. It’s a natural consequence that an overly complicated law (the DMA) has resulted in an ever-more-complicated set of guidelines and policies (from Apple): byzantine compliance with a byzantine law.</p>

<p>Because it’s so complicated and hard to understand, it’s difficult even to summarize with a headline describing what’s new. Even if you understand it enough to just want to express anger at Apple for spiteful compliance and greed, it’s hard to sum up why you’re angry in a succinct headline or tweet.</p>

<hr />

<p>The bottom line, as I understand it, is the following (but I could be wrong about some of this<sup id="fnr1-2025-06-28"><a href="#fn1-2025-06-28">1</a></sup> — if I am, let me know, and I’ll try to correct it):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Developers who just do the simplest thing possible — distribute through the App Store and process all payments using Apple’s IAP — will continue to pay the same commissions, 30% by default, or 15% for Small Business Program developers and recurring subscriptions after the first year. Of course this is what Apple would prefer developers do.</p></li>
<li><p>Big developers, distributing through the App Store but processing their own payments, will still owe Apple a commission of around 20% on non-IAP purchases: 13% for “store services”, 5% for the new Core Technology Commission (replacing the €0.50 per-download Core Technology Fee), and 2% for “initial acquisition”. Small Developer Program members and recurring subscriptions after the first year pay 15% — no “initial acquisition fee” and a reduced “store services” fee of 10%. But everyone’s on the hook for the 5% CTC.</p></li>
<li><p>Apps distributed through the App Store can pay a reduced rate of 5% for “store services” (down from 13%) by opting into a reduced “Tier 1”. Rather than this “Tier 1” being an appealing choice for any developers, I think the point of it is for Apple to assert that those App Store features justify 8 percent of Apple’s commission on purchases: automatic software updates, reviews and ratings, surfacing through search for anything other than an exact name match, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/store-services-tiers/">and a whole lot more</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>One consequence of the €0.50 per-download Core Technology Fee (CTF) being replaced by a 5% Core Technology Commission (CTC) is that there will no longer be a penalty for small developers who have a free-to-download app that hits over one million EU downloads. That was a legitimate problem with the CTF — an app with 5 million EU downloads would owe Apple €2 million for the CTF, but might be generating far less than that (or even nothing at all) in revenue. But another consequence of switching to the CTC from the CTF is that super-popular apps from super-big companies that don’t sell digital goods from their apps will continue to pay nothing at all. E.g. unless Meta starts selling digital goods from within their apps, they’ll continue to pay nothing at all to Apple for zillion-download apps like Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. That was a shortcoming with the App Store’s model that the CTF was designed to correct.</p></li>
<li><p>All of this additional complication is, I believe, just for apps distributed through the App Store. Feel free to blame Apple as much as you want for spiteful compliance (especially when it comes to payments made on the web, from links in apps), but part of this is on the European Commission for demanding not only that Apple allow apps to be distributed outside the App Store (which is somewhat reasonable), but also for requiring Apple to allow outside payments for apps distributed through the App Store. Apps and games distributed through alternative EU app marketplaces or web downloads are only on the hook for the 5% CTC (by the end of the year, when it replaces the CTF). But there is no free lunch — iOS apps and games distributed outside the App Store that require a purchase, or offer digital content for sale, must pay the 5% CTC.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are a lot of people <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/26/tim-sweeney-slams-apples-unlawful-eu-app-store-changes/">who think</a> what Apple is “supposed” to do is collect no commission or fees at all on anything other than IAP from apps and games that are distributed through the App Store. That Apple should collect no commission or fees from apps distributed outside the App Store, nor any commission or fees from apps in the App Store that offer their own payment processing — and, thus, that Apple should set their own IAP commission accordingly, as something akin to Stripe or PayPal, in the single-digit percentage range. That’s obviously not in Apple’s interest. But it’s also <em>not</em> what the European Commission has suggested the DMA demands.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1-2025-06-28">
<p>One thing I might be wrong about is that these new terms could be read to suggest that developers who stick with the App Store and Apple’s IAP now pay just 20 percent commission under the new EU terms. That’d be really weird, insofar as it would mean that developers in the EU get an 80/20 split for App Store distribution + IAP, but apps everywhere else in the world still get 70/30 for the same thing. That doesn’t make sense unless there’s another shoe to drop, and Apple is going to reduce IAP to 80/20 worldwide soon. (Which would be a great move on Apple’s part — something that would actually earn them back some developer goodwill.)&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-06-28"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<p>Joe Rossignol:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company has promoted its Brad Pitt racing film with
advertisements across at least six iPhone apps leading up to
today’s wide release, including the App Store, Apple Wallet,
Apple Sports, Apple Podcasts, iTunes Store, and of course the
Apple TV app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of those apps have ads in them all the time. It’s certainly fine for Apple to use those ad spots to promote their own movie. Even with Apple Sports, which most of the time has no ads at all, I think it’s fine for Apple to occasionally drop a promotion in there for something of their own. And <em>F1 The Movie</em> is a sports movie. The Apple Wallet push notification isn’t just a little different, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/more_on_apples_trust-eroding_f1_the_movie_wallet_ad">it’s a lot different</a>.</p>

<p>I will also note one other sort-of promotion. I play the mini crossword every morning in Apple News. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/apple-news-mini-crossword-f1.png">Today’s 1-down clue</a> was “<em>F1 The Movie</em> star Brad ____”. I think that’s a clever on-brand tie-in. Fun, not obnoxious. But with the smell of that Wallet push-notification fart still hanging in the air, not as much fun as it otherwise would have been.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Beth Mole, reporting for Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The vaccine panel hand-selected by health secretary and
anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Thursday voted
overwhelmingly to drop federal recommendations for seasonal flu
shots that contain the ethyl-mercury containing preservative
thimerosal. The panel did so after hearing a misleading and
cherry-picked presentation from an anti-vaccine activist.</p>

<p>There is extensive data from the last quarter century proving that
the antiseptic preservative is safe, with no harms identified
beyond slight soreness at the injection site, but none of that
data was presented during today’s meeting.</p>

<p>The significance of the vote is unclear for now. The vast majority
of seasonal influenza vaccines currently used in the US — about
96 percent of flu shots in 2024–2025 — do not contain thimerosal.
The preservative is only included in multi-dose vials of seasonal
flu vaccines, where it prevents the growth of bacteria and fungi
potentially introduced as doses are withdrawn.</p>

<p>However, thimerosal is more common elsewhere in the world for
various multi-dose vaccine vials, which are cheaper than the
single-dose vials more commonly used in the US. If other countries
follow the US’s lead and abandon thimerosal, it could increase the
cost of vaccines in other countries and, in turn, lead to fewer
vaccinations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having an ignorant conspiracy nut lead the Department of Health and Human Services is angering and worrisome, to say the least. But it’s also incredibly frustrating, because Donald Trump himself isn’t an anti-vaxxer. In fact, one of the few great achievements of the first Trump Administration was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Warp_Speed">Operation Warp Speed</a>, a highly successful effort spearheaded by the US federal government to “facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.” Early in the pandemic experts were concerned it would take years before a Covid vaccine might be available. Instead, multiple effective vaccines were widely available — and administered free of charge — in the first half of 2021, only a year after the pandemic broke. It was a remarkable success and any other president who spearheaded Operation Warp Speed would have rightfully taken tremendous credit for it.</p>

<p>But instead, while plotting his return to office, Trump smelled opportunity with the anti-vax contingent <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/27/trump-stupid-americans">of the out-and-proud Stupid-Americans</a>, and now here we are, with a genuine know-nothing lunatic like RFK Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services. God help us if another pandemic hits in the next few years.</p>

<p>Banger of a post by “tarltontarlton” on Reddit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That same process is happening now with stupid people. They’re
transcending their individual limitations, finding each other and
becoming out-and-proud Stupid-Americans. [...]</p>

<p>How individual stupid Americans are becoming the collective,
self-aware group of Stupid-Americans is a great idea for a lot of
very fancy journalism I’m sure. It’s probably got something to do
with the internet, where stupid people can find and repeat stupid
things to each other over and over and over again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe it has a <em>lot</em> to do with the Internet, which has functioned as a terribly efficient sorting machine. It used to be that there were conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans. Both political parties were, effectively, shades of purple. Now we’ve sorted ourselves, and the result is the palpable increase in polarization. Low-IQ stupidity might still be spread across both sides of the political aisle, but willful ignorance — the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/11/30/asimov-cult-of-ignorance">dogmatic cultish belief</a> that loudmouths’ opinions are on equal ground with facts and evidence presented by informed experts — is the entire basis of the MAGA movement. A regular stupid person might say, “Well, I don’t know anything about vaccines, so I better listen to my doctor, who is highly educated and well-informed on the subject.” An out-and-proud Stupid-American says “I don’t know anything about vaccines either, so I’m going to listen to a kook who admits that a worm ate part of his brain, because I can’t understand the science but I <em>can</em> understand conspiracy theories.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If written language survives the next six weeks, we’ll be writing
about Donald Trump for a thousand years. But whatever else there
is to say, the most important thing about Donald Trump, the thing
that is obvious from watching him speak for just 14 seconds, is
that he is profoundly stupid. Whatever it is that he might be
talking about or doing at any given moment, it’s clear that while
he has a reptilian instinct for reading and stoking conflict, he
has no real idea what’s going on and he doesn’t really care to.
Stupid is what he is <em>and</em> where he comes from. It is his mind and
his soul. Catholic was what JFK was. Gay was what Harvey Milk was.
Stupid is <em>who</em> Donald Trump is.</p>

<p>And that’s what they love most, the Stupid-American voters.</p>

<p>Remember that sentence you heard at the beginning of all this in
2016? “He’s just saying what everybody is thinking.”</p>

<p>But see, not everybody was thinking that Hillary Clinton was an
alien, that global warming was a Chinese hoax and that what
America needed most of all was a plywood wall stretching from
Texas to California. Only the stupid people were. And suddenly, in
an instant, the most powerful man on earth was thinking just like
them. With his clueless smirk and unstoppable rise, he turned
people whose stupidity made them feel like nobody into people who
felt like everybody.</p>

<p>That’s why he’ll never lose them. Because it was never about what
he did or didn’t do. All that stuff is very confusing and the
Stupid-American community isn’t interested in the details. They
love him for who he is, which is one of them, and because he shows
them every day that Stupid-Americans can reach the social
mountaintop.</p>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@czeins/114739403773350112">This is a funny gag from Claude Zeins</a>, but if you think about it, it shows just how destructive Apple’s decision was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/26/apple-wallet-sends-push-notification-ad-pushing-f1-the-movie">to send a push notification from the Wallet app promoting <em>F1 The Movie</em></a>.</p>

<!-- Backup: https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/claude-zeins-f1-wallet-gag.jpeg -->

<p>It’s a fact that no company can inject an ad into your physical wallet. It just can’t happen. So if Apple’s message to users is that they should trust Apple Wallet, and move more of their “shit that goes in your wallet” life from their traditional analog wallet into their digital Apple Wallet, that’s the bar. No ads, ever. They’re competing against the privacy and intimacy of one of the most personal things people carry with them.</p>

<p>It’s not just that many people find ads annoying, no matter where they appear. It’s that Apple Wallet ought to be sacrosanct — like the Passwords and Journal apps. Apple is asking us to trust this app with our finances, our <a href="https://learn.wallet.apple/id">identity cards</a>, and our keys. I’m 99.9 percent certain this <em>F1</em> ad was just blasted out to zillions of Wallet users indiscriminately, but some number of users who got it — especially people who know they’re in the demographic for the movie — surely think they got the ad because Wallet is tracking their interests and activities. Like, what if you recently bought tickets to see another summer blockbuster movie? Using Apple Wallet? And then you got this ad? It’d be completely sensible to be spooked by that, and conclude that Apple Wallet is tracking you.</p>

<p>Sending this ad is completely destructive to all the hard work other teams at Apple have done to make Apple Wallet actually private — and, more importantly, <em>to get users to believe that it’s private</em>. That Apple can be trusted in ways that other “big tech” companies cannot. The perception of privacy is just as important as the technical details that make something actually private. I try very seldom to call for anyone to be fired, but I think whoever authorized this movie ad through Wallet push notifications ought to be canned.</p>

<p>Sarah Perez, writing at TechCrunch Tuesday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple customers aren’t thrilled they’re getting an ad from the
Apple Wallet app promoting the tech giant’s original film “F1 the
Movie.” <a href="https://x.com/ParkerOrtolani/status/1937551035825807545">Across</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWallet/comments/1ljbjrs/how_do_i_turn_this_off">social</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1ljd94e/disable_fandango_ad_from_apple_pay/">media</a>, iPhone owners are
complaining that their Wallet app sent out a push notification
offering a $10 discount at Fandango for anyone buying two or more
tickets to the film.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/24/apple-wallet-notification-f1-movie-ad/">Joe Rossignol, MacRumors</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today sent out an ad to some iPhone users in the form of a
Wallet app push notification, and not everyone is happy about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s an understatement, to say the very least. See if you can find a single comment from anyone who was happy about receiving this push notification ad. Seriously, let me know if you find <em>one</em> statement in support of this.</p>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@caseyliss/114738626109660386">Casey Liss</a>, succinct as ever:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>🤮</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ad itself, from Apple, read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Pay <br />
$10 off at Fandango</p>

<p>Save on 2+ tickets to F1® The Movie with APPLEPAYTEN. Ends 6/29.
While supplies last. Terms apply.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the justified outrage over receiving any ad from a system-level component like Wallet in the first place, this particular ad sucks in multiple ways. Why did Apple put a “®” after “F1” in the movie title? Why not put a “®” next to “Apple Pay” and “Fandango” too? What supplies are running out on this promotion? Why add that “terms apply”? This is just a shit notification from top to bottom, putting aside whether any such notification should have been sent in the first place.</p>

<p><a href="https://mas.to/@Kerry/114738862216086251">iOS 26 adds new settings inside the Wallet app</a> to allow fine-grained control over notifications, including the ability to turn off notifications for “Offers &amp; Promotions” (Wallet app → (···) → Notifications — notably, this is <em>not</em> in the Settings app). That’s good. But (a) iOS 26 is months away from being released to the general public — there exists no way to opt out of such notifications now; and (b) at least for me, I was by default opted <em>in</em> to this setting on my iOS 26 devices. (It is also, when you think about it, perhaps a worrying sign regarding Apple’s future plans that this setting has been added to Wallet for iOS 26.)</p>

<p>This was such a boneheaded marketing decision on Apple’s part. They cost themselves way more in goodwill and trust than they possibly could have earned in additional <em>F1 The Movie</em> — wait, sorry, my bad, <em>F1® The Movie</em> — box office ticket sales. It’s like Apple got paid to exemplify <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/my-mcluhan-lecture-on-enshittification-ea343342b9bc">Cory Doctorow’s “enshittification” theory</a>. Apple Wallet doesn’t present itself as a marketing vehicle. It presents itself as a privacy-protecting system service.</p>

<p>Some sad news. The San Francisco Chronicle (<a href="https://apple.news/AStXd9PofQ7yTRc24ijze8A">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The eight people killed in a sudden storm while boating on Lake
Tahoe over the weekend were a close-knit group of friends and
family members who had gathered for a birthday celebration,
according to a spokesperson representing some of the victims.</p>

<p>The boating trip was a part of the 71st birthday celebration for
Paula Bozinovich, one of the people who perished in the lake, when
their 27-foot powerboat capsized during a sudden, violent storm on
Saturday. Authorities on Tuesday released the names of those
killed when the boat sank near D.L. Bliss State Park, overwhelmed
by 8-foot waves and wind gusts topping 35 mph.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bozinovich’s husband Terry and son, Josh — a DoorDash executive — were among the victims. Via email, Brian Croll, who worked in product marketing at Apple for a <em>long</em> time before retiring a few years ago, wrote the following, which I’m publishing with his permission:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paula was an employee who you are not going to see profiled in any
books on the history of Apple or Steve Jobs. She worked closely
with the ops team to ensure CDs and then DVDs shipped on time and
correctly packaged in a box. She knew all the systems and the
right people to make things happen. She was always committed to
getting things better than just right — perfect. Paula’s
extraordinary commitment, along with all the hundreds of other
unheralded employees, translated the vision of Steve, the
designers, the engineers, and the marketing people into a shipping
product.</p>

<p>One of the secrets behind Apple’s success has been its ability to
execute. Paula was an important part of that fine-tuned machine.
She was also quite a character!</p>

<p>I’m sending you this because I’ve seen front page obituaries of
executives who probably did way more harm than good to their
companies, and yet when you scratch the surface of a successful
company you find that people like Paula make all the difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing but my warmest thoughts to her friends and family.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Cdespinosa/114746774944556319">Chris Espinosa</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m shattered to hear that Apple software ops stalwart Paula
Bozinovich was killed in a boat capsize on Lake Tahoe. She truly
embodied the spirit of the company in everything she did. A joy to
work with and a tragedy to lose her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve heard from a bunch of folks today about her, and all of them emphasize two things. First, she was very, very good at her job. Second, she was very, very fun. One person said she exemplified what has always made Apple so unique: that her personality was such that she probably never would have gotten any job at all at any other big company, but she was absolutely perfectly an Apple person’s Apple person.</p>

<p>Stephen Hackett:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our 14-day national nightmare is over. As of Developer Beta 2, the
Finder icon in macOS Tahoe has been updated to reflect 30 years of
tradition:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/About-Finder-Beta-2.jpg" class="noborder">
<img
  src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/About-Finder-Beta-2.jpg"
  alt = "Screenshots of the Finder About box, showing the Finder icon, left to right: MacOS 18 Sequioa, MacOS 26 Tahoe Beta 1, MacOS Tahoe Beta 2"
  width = 450
/></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m going to strongly disagree here. The Tahoe beta 2 Finder icon is <em>slightly</em> better, but seeing it this way makes it obvious that the problem with the Tahoe Finder icon isn’t whether it’s dark/light or light/dark from left to right. It’s that with this Tahoe design it’s not 50/50. It’s the <em>appliqué</em> — the right side (the face in profile) looks like something stuck on top of a blue face tile. That’s not the Finder logo.</p>

<p>The Finder logo is the Mac logo. The Macintosh is the platform that held Apple together when, by all rights, the company should have fallen apart. It’s a great logo, period, and the second-most-important logo Apple owns, after the Apple logo itself. Fucking around with it like this, making the right-side in-profile face a stick-on layer rather than a full half of the mark, is akin to Coca-Cola fucking around with the typeface for the word “Cola” in its logo. Like, what are you doing? Why are you screwing with a perfect mark?</p>

<p>There are an infinite number of ways Apple could do this while remaining true to the original logo. <a href="https://x.com/flarup/status/1932798949749936200">Here’s a take from Michael Flarup</a> that glasses it up but keeps it true to itself:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/flarup-finder-glass.jpeg" class="noborder">
  <img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/flarup-finder-glass.jpeg"
    alt = "Michael Flarup's take on a Liquid Glass style Finder icon."
    width = 450
  /></a></p>

<p>Especially in the field of computers, no company can be a slave to tradition and history. But you ought to respect it. This new Finder icon doesn’t.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> And <a href="https://pdx.social/@louie/114742479098781460">here are some excellent takes</a> on an updated Finder icon by Louie Mantia, along with some astute commentary. Mantia writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I really, really do not like spending my time pointing this out.
I could write a whole blog post but I don’t want to seem angry
about it. I just think the right solutions are simpler than what
they’re doing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No surprise, but Mantia’s icons <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/louie-finder-glass-light.png">look</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/louie-finder-glass-dark.png">perfect</a> to me. Perfectly Liquid Glass-y, perfectly Finder-y.</p>

<p>From iyO’s home page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iyo one is a revolutionary new kind of computer without a
screen. it can run apps just like your smartphone. The key
difference is you talk to it through a natural language interface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/23/io-iyo-aye-aye-aye">Like I wrote yesterday</a>, I’d never heard of iyO before. But from the description above, you can obviously see how they’d feel like the new OpenAI/LoveFrom io name stomps on their trademark. (One minor curiosity: iyO itself seems unsure how to capitalize the letters in its own name: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/iyO-IyO-iyo.png">a single cropped screenshot of their own home page</a> shows “iyO”, “IyO”, and “iyo”.)</p>

<p>iyO “graduated” from X (which is entirely separate from Elon Musk’s X), Google’s “moonshot factory”, in 2021. <a href="https://x.company/projects/iyo/">The description there</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iyO is on a mission to bring natural language computing to
billions of people. The team has created the world’s first audio
computer that you can talk to like a friend. While at X, the team
developed their initial prototypes. Now an independent company,
iyO is creating screenless, natural language computing with mixed
audio reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite having “graduated” four years ago, iyO is <a href="https://www.iyo.audio/products/iyo-one">still only taking pre-orders</a> for the iyO One, their ungainly-looking ear computer. ($100 seems too good to be true for what they’re promising. <strong>Update:</strong> Ah-ha, turns out $100 is just the pre-order deposit. They’re <a href="https://www.shop.iyo.audio/shop/p/iyo-one">going to cost $1,000 to $1,200</a> if they ever actually ship, which I think is a big <em>if</em> — this thing has vaporware written all over it.)</p>

<p>Lastly, last April, iyO founder and CEO Jason Rugolo demonstrated prototypes <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jason_rugolo_welcome_to_the_world_of_audio_computers">in a 13-minute TED talk</a>. Seems cool, but some of the features already exist with AirPods, and all of the feature <em>could</em> exist with AirPods. I don’t see the future of a dedicated audio computer — especially ones as ugly as these — when the entire feature set can be duplicated with smart earbuds paired to your phone.</p>

<p>Brooks Barnes, writing for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pixar knew that <em>Elio</em>, an original space adventure, would most
likely struggle in its first weekend at the box office.</p>

<p>Animated movies based on original stories have become harder sells
in theaters, even for the once-unstoppable Pixar. At a time when
streaming services have proliferated and the broader economy is
unsettled, families want assurance that spending the money for
tickets will be worth it.</p>

<p>But the turnout for <em>Elio</em> was worse — much worse — than even
Pixar had expected. The film, which cost at least $250 million to
make and market, collected an estimated $21 million from Thursday
evening through Sunday at theaters in the United States and
Canada, according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. It
was Pixar’s worst opening-weekend result ever. The previous bottom
was <em>Elemental</em>, which arrived to $30 million in 2023.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.threads.com/@technologizer/post/DLQKsxppcWt">Harry McCracken</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wasn’t aware this movie had come out, and still can’t tell you
what it’s about. And I’ve been a Pixar fan since before they made
movies. That seems like a problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hadn’t heard of this movie until today either. Disney and Pixar have a marketing problem. One part of the problem is that Pixar has made some decidedly meh movies in recent years. “Pixar” used to stand for nothing less than excellence. Now it stands for “somewhere in the range of OK to great”. But another is that even when they make a good one — which <em>Elio</em> might be — they suck at getting word out.</p>

<p>Hayden Field, reporting for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenAI has scrubbed mentions of io, the hardware startup co-founded by famous Apple designer Jony Ive, from its website and social media channels. The sudden change closely follows their recent announcement of OpenAI’s nearly $6.5 billion acquisition and plans to create dedicated AI hardware.</p>

<p>OpenAI tells The Verge the deal is still happening, but it scrubbed mentions due to a trademark lawsuit from Iyo, the hearing device startup spun out of Google’s moonshot factory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you visit <a href="https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/">the “Sam and Jony” page on OpenAI’s website</a> — where the short film teasing io used to be — it now simply says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This page is temporarily down due to a court order following a trademark complaint from iyO about our use of the name “io.” We don’t agree with the complaint and are reviewing our options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps I’m not paying close enough attention, but this is the first I’ve heard of iyO. The two names certainly sound alike but they don’t look alike. Are homophones trademarkable? I would expect a terse letter from Coca-Cola’s lawyers if I tried selling soda under name “Koke” (or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Letters-Nut-Ted-L-Nancy/dp/B000SR7RNS/?tag=df-amzn-20">like Ted Nancy tried</a>, Kiet Doke), so I guess so.</p>

<p>I suppose the question is how did OpenAI not see this coming, knowing that Google is probably their biggest rival? (Not to mention that Google might feel salty about the encroachment on their I/O developer conference name.)</p>

<p>Joe Rossignol at MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has marked its day-old <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/20/apple-shares-the-parent-presentation-for-mac/">The Parent Presentation</a> video
on YouTube as private, meaning that it is no longer available to
watch. Apple has also moved The Parent Presentation to the bottom
of its College Students page, effectively burying it. When we
reported on the marketing campaign yesterday, the presentation was
prominently featured at the top of the page.</p>

<p>It is unclear why Apple is suddenly hiding the ad, or if it will
return. Apple did not immediately respond to our request for
comment. On social media, some people said that the ad was cringe
or gross, so perhaps Apple pulled the video due to overly negative
reception. To be clear, this is merely speculation, and there were
others who found humor in the video.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 7.5-minute video, which at the moment is still available to watch from re-uploads <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHFUmPbODbI&amp;t=1s">on YouTube</a> and <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1936057701387428183">X</a> — stars <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/person/2807375-martin-herlihy?language=en-US">Martin Herlihy</a> from SNL’s “Please Don’t Destroy” triumvirate. I wouldn’t describe it as “cringe”, but I also wouldn’t describe it as “funny”. (If Herlihy wrote this, it would suggest that his cohorts <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/person/3631826-ben-marshall?language=en-US">Ben Marshall</a> and <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/person/3631835-john-higgins?language=en-US">John Higgins</a> are the funny ones in the trio.) It’s also not the least bit offensive, so it really is unclear why Apple pulled it. If it’s because it’s not funny, how did it not only get approved and produced, but posted for 24 hours? Is Apple’s new marketing strategy to just publish new ads and then <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/09/apple-crush-apology">wait to see how the world reacts</a> before deciding if they’re any good or not?</p>

<p>One obvious problem with “The Parent Presentation” video is that the gist is that <em>everyone</em> involved is stupid: high school kids (the ostensible target audience?) are too stupid to know how to ask their parents for a MacBook for college, parents are too stupid to know they should buy their kids a good laptop, and even Herlihy’s lecturer is a doofus who himself doesn’t know how to deliver a presentation. I don’t know how this got past the concept stage.</p>

<p>To top things off, <a href="https://www.apple.com/education/college-students/#presentation">the downloadable slide presentation</a> — which Apple still has available in Keynote, PowerPoint, and Google Slides formats — is entirely typeset in Arial. I would take my son’s MacBook away from him if he came to me with a presentation set in Arial.</p>

<p>Joe Rossignol, writing for MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A bit of sad news for old iPods: Macs might be losing FireWire
support.</p>

<p>The first macOS Tahoe developer beta does not support the legacy
FireWire 400 and FireWire 800 data-transfer standards, according
to <a href="https://x.com/NekoMichiUBC/status/1932876748661608561">@NekoMichi on X</a>, and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1l7gb1r/macos_tahoe_dp1_seems_remove_firewire_800_support/">Reddit post</a>. As a result,
the first few iPod models and old external storage drives that
rely on FireWire cannot be synced with or mounted on a Mac running
the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/install-macos-tahoe-developer-beta/">macOS Tahoe beta</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike on macOS Sequoia and earlier versions, the first macOS
Tahoe beta does not include a FireWire section in the System
Settings app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All good things must come to an end, and FireWire was a very good thing indeed. High-performance, reliable, easy to use.</p>

<p>Apple, back in 2001, “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2001/08/22Apple-FireWire-Wins-2001-Primetime-Emmy-Engineering-Award/">Apple FireWire Wins 2001 Primetime Emmy Engineering Award</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s FireWire technology will be honored by the Academy of
Television Arts &amp; Sciences in an awards presentation held tonight
at the academy’s Goldenson Theatre in Hollywood. Apple will
receive a 2001 Primetime Emmy Engineering Award for FireWire’s
material impact on the television industry.</p>

<p>Apple invented FireWire in the mid-90s and shepherded it to become
the established cross-platform industry standard IEEE 1394.
FireWire is a high-speed serial input/output technology for
connecting digital devices such as digital camcorders and cameras
to desktop and portable computers. Widely adopted by digital
peripheral companies such as Sony, Canon, JVC and Kodak, FireWire
has become the established industry standard for both consumers
and professionals.</p>

<p>Tom Nichols, writing for The Atlantic (gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Donald Trump has done what he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/18/politics/trump-peacemaker-iran-israel-conflict-analysis">swore</a> he would not
do: involve the United States in a war in the Middle East. His
supporters will tie themselves in knots (as Vice President J. D.
Vance <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1934996183702704404">did</a> last week) trying to jam the square peg of
Trump’s promises into the round hole of his actions. And many of
them may avoid calling this “war” at all, even though that’s what
Trump himself <a href="https://x.com/trump_repost/status/1936580633775792406">called it tonight</a>. They will want to see it
as a quick win against an obstinate regime that will eventually
declare bygones and come to the table. But whether bombing Iran
was a good idea or a bad idea — and it could turn out to be
either, or both — it is war by any definition of the term, and
something Trump had vowed he would avoid. [...]</p>

<p>Only one outcome is certain: Hypocrisy in the region and around
the world will reach galactic levels as nations wring their hands
and silently pray that the B-2s carrying the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/20/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-fordo-bunker-buster-bomb.html">bunker-buster</a>
bombs did their job.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/timothysnyder.bsky.social/post/3ls6a4s45w22q">Timothy Snyder, on Bluesky</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Five things to remember about war:</p>

<ol>
<li>Many things reported with confidence in the first hours and
days will turn out not to be true.</li>
<li>Whatever they say, the people who start wars are often thinking
chiefly about domestic politics.</li>
<li>The rationale given for a war will change over time, such that
actual success or failure in achieving a named objective is
less relevant than one might think.</li>
<li>Wars are unpredictable.</li>
<li>Wars are easy to start and hard to stop.</li>

<p>Julian Chokkattu, writing for Wired:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can’t mount a cinema camera on a Formula One race car. These
nimble vehicles are built to precise specs, and capturing racing
footage from the driver’s point of view isn’t as simple as
slapping a GoPro on and calling it a day. That’s the challenge
Apple faced after Joseph Kosinski and Claudio Miranda, the
director and cinematographer of the upcoming <em>F1</em> Apple Original,
wanted to use real POV racing footage in the film.</p>

<p>If you’ve watched a Formula One race lately, you’ve probably seen
clips that show an angle from just behind the cockpit, with the
top or side of the driver’s helmet in the frame. Captured by
onboard cameras embedded in the car, the resulting footage is
designed for broadcast, at a lower resolution using specific color
spaces and codecs. Converting it to match the look of the rest of
the <em>F1</em> film would be too challenging to be feasible. Instead,
Apple’s engineering team replaced the broadcast module with a
camera composed of iPhone parts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think back to Phil Schiller, <a href="https://vimeo.com/130510366">on stage at my WWDC show in 2015</a>, saying that Apple viewed itself then not just as one of the leading camera companies in the world, but <a href="https://www.imore.com/gruber-and-schiller-our-full-transcript-talk-show-wwdc"><em>the</em> leading camera company in the world</a>.</p>

<p>Cynthia Littleton, in a long profile for Variety:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When pressed about what Apple’s investments in movies and TV shows
have meant for the company as a whole, Cook explains that Apple is
at heart “a toolmaker,” delivering computers and other devices
that enable creativity in users. (This vision for the company, and
the “toolmaker” term specifically, was first articulated by Jobs
in the early 1980s.) “We’re a toolmaker,” Cook says again. “We
make tools for creative people to empower them to do things they
couldn’t do before. So we were doing lots of business with
Hollywood well before we were in the TV business.</p>

<p>“We studied it for years before we decided to do [Apple TV+]. I
know there’s a lot of different views out there about why we’re
into it. We’re into it to tell great stories, and we want it to be
a great business as well. That’s why we’re into it, just plain and
simple.” [...]</p>

<p>Media analysts and observers have wondered how the content side of
Apple threads together with the hardware sales that fuel the core
business. As Cook sees it, that’s not the point, although such
connections are emerging organically in the course of doing
business, as evidenced by “F1” and the camera tech. “I don’t have
it in my mind that I’m going to sell more iPhones because of it,”
Cook says. “I don’t think about that at all. I think about it as a
business. And just like we leverage the best of Apple across
iPhones and across our services, we try to leverage the best of
Apple TV+.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple TV+ has been killing it with original shows. Maybe with <em>F1</em> they can start bringing that magic to movies.</p>

	<summary type="text">My biggest takeaway from WWDC 2025 is that Apple seemingly took some lessons to heart from its unfulfilled promises of a year ago. This year’s WWDC wasn’t merely focused on what Apple is confident it can ship in the next 12 months, but on what they can ship *this fall*.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>“<em>This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away — to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. What he was doing. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!</em>” <br />
—Yoda, <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em></p>

<p>My biggest takeaway from WWDC 2025 is that Apple seemingly took some lessons to heart from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">its unfulfilled promises</a> of a year ago. This year’s WWDC wasn’t merely focused on what Apple is confident it can ship in the next 12 months, but on what they can ship <em>this fall</em>. I might be overlooking a minor exception or two, but every major feature announced in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/101/">the WWDC 2025 keynote</a> was both demonstratable in product briefings, <em>and</em> is currently available in the developer beta seeds. I was also told, explicitly, by Apple executives, that Apple plans to ship everything shown last week in the fall.</p>

<p>That’s as it should be, and a strong return to form for the company. It takes confidence to promise only what you know you can ship, and it takes execution to ship what you’ve promised. If there’s more coming in the early months of 2026, announce those features when they’re ready. It’s proven very effective for Apple to spread the debut of new features across the entire calendar year, with many major features not appearing until the .3, .4, or even .5 OS releases. I think it will prove just as effective marketing-wise to spread the <em>announcement</em> of more features throughout the year as well.</p>

<p>There’s no question that it’s a little weird for every one of Apple’s platforms to have jumped to version 26. I mean, VisionOS skipped 23 version numbers. Presumably, when Apple next unveils a new OS (HomeOS?), it’s going to <em>start</em> at version 26, 27, or 28. But I’m already getting used to this, and I think the underlying logic laid out by Craig Federighi at the outset of the keynote is true: with Apple now up to six developer platforms (Mac, iPhone, iPad, Vision, TV, Watch), it had gotten hard to keep track of which version numbers corresponded to the same year. That matters not just for the convenience of knowing, in years to come, when specific versions of each OS were released, but it also matters because none of these platforms exist in isolation. They’re all parts of a cohesive whole, a cross-device “Apple OS 26” experience, as it were.</p>

<p>One thing I haven’t seen commented on, though, is that switching to year-based version numbers establishes as de facto policy something that has now been true for quite a few years, but which Apple has never officially acknowledged: that each of these platforms will get a major version release annually. 20 years ago the update schedule for Mac OS X was rather erratic:</p>

<p>OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion (which began the odd four-year run where the Mac’s OS name didn’t contain “Mac”) arrived in July 2012, and thereafter a new major version has shipped in September, October, or November (MacOS 11 Big Sur, in 2020) every single year. This rigorous annual schedule is a hallmark of the Tim Cook era at Apple, and clearly reflects his personality (as the erratic/idiosyncratic schedule of the mid-2000s reflected Steve Jobs’s).</p>

<h2>iPadOS Windowing</h2>

<p>The pedant in me is mildly perturbed that the new windowing system unveiled for iPadOS 26 is largely being discussed under the term “multitasking”. It’s windowing. One way to understand the difference is that the original Mac OS (a.k.a. System 1) had windowing — windowing that looked and worked a lot like this — but no multitasking. The very early Mac could run just one app a time, but the running app could open multiple windows. But, whatever. It’s all good.</p>

<p>One thing I find interesting is that while <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102364">split screen and Slide Over</a> have been eliminated in the new system (<a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/not-an-ipad-pro-review/">praise be</a>), Stage Manager is still a feature. Just plain windowing is as it should be: ad hoc. You make windows and move them around and resize them however you want. Stage Manager is fussier — it’s a more complex system for users who wish to organize their windows into something akin to projects or related tasks. </p>

<p>So, effectively, Apple, three years ago, jumped straight to a more complex, more fiddly option — Stage Manager — and only now has added the simpler, more obvious, not fiddly at all option (windowing). It’s been a weird journey, but I think iPadOS has finally arrived at a place where showing more than one app or document at a time on-screen is what it should have been all along: easy and obvious.</p>

<h2>Liquid Glass</h2>

<p>Alan Dye, introducing Liquid Glass, around the 8m:20s mark in the keynote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Software is the heart and soul of our products. It brings them to
life, shapes their personality, and defines their purpose. At
Apple, we’ve always believed it’s the deep integration of hardware
and software that makes interacting with technology intuitive,
beautiful, and a joy to use. iOS 7 introduced a simplified design
built on distinct layers, smooth animations, and new colors. It
redefined our design language for years to come. Now, with the
powerful advances in our hardware, silicon, and graphics
technologies, we have the opportunity to lay the foundation for
the next chapter of our software. Today we’re excited to announce
our broadest design update ever. Our goal is a beautiful new
design that brings joy and delight to every user experience, one
that’s more personal, and puts greater focus on your content, all
while still feeling instantly familiar.</p>

<p>And for the first time, we’re introducing a universal design
across our platforms. This unified design language creates a more
harmonious experience as you move between products, while
maintaining the qualities that make each unique. Inspired by the
physicality and richness of VisionOS, we challenged ourselves to
make something purely digital feel natural and alive. From how it
looks to how it feels as it dynamically responds to touch. To
achieve this, we began by rethinking the fundamental elements that
make up our software, and it starts with an entirely new
expressive material we call Liquid Glass. With the optical
qualities of glass and a fluidity that only Apple can achieve, it
transforms depending on your content or even your context, and
brings more clarity to navigation and controls. It beautifully
refracts light and dynamically reacts to your movement with
specular highlights. This material brings a new level of vitality
to every aspect of your experience. From the smallest elements you
interact with to larger ones, it responds in real time to your
content and your input. Creating a more lively experience that we
think you’ll find truly delightful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compare and contrast to <a href="https://youtu.be/dHrVGk0WwYM?t=381">Steve Jobs introducing Aqua at Macworld San Francisco in January 2000</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So this is the architecture, except there’s one more thing. The
one more thing is, we have been secretly for the last 18 months
designing a completely new user interface. And that new user
interface builds on Apple’s legacy and carries it into the next
century. And we call that new user interface Aqua, because it’s
liquid. One of the design goals was when you saw it, you wanted to
lick it. [...]</p>

<p>When you design a new user interface, you have to start off
humbly. You have to start off saying, what are the simplest
elements in it? What does a button look like? And you spend months
working on a button. That’s a button in Aqua. This is what radio
buttons look like. Simple things. This is what checkboxes look
like. This is what popup lists look like. Again, you’re starting
to get the feel of this, a little different. This is what sliders
can look like. Now, let me show you windows. This is what the top
of windows look like. These three buttons look like a traffic
signal, don’t they? Red means close the window. Yellow means
minimize the window. And green means maximize the window. Pretty
simple. And tremendous fit and finish in this operating system.
When you roll over these things, you get those. You see them? And
when you are no longer the key window, they go transparent. So a
lot of fit and finish in this.</p>

<p>In addition to the fit and finish, we paid a lot of attention to
dynamics. Not only how do things look, but how do they move, how
do they behave. And our goal in this user interface was twofold.
One, we wanted to give a much more powerful user interface to our
pro customers. But two, at the very same time, we wanted to make
this the dream user interface for somebody who’s never even
touched a computer before. And that’s really hard to do. It’s like
when we do films at Pixar. It’s really easy, it’s a lot easier, to
make a film that appeals to five-year-olds and under. But it’s
very difficult to make one film that five-year-olds love and that
their parents also love. And that was the goal of this user
interface. To make it span the range so that people turning on
their iMac for the first time were enchanted with it, and it was
super easy to use, and yet, our pro customers also felt, <em>My God,
this takes me to places I thought I could never get to</em>. And
that’s what we tried to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Re-watching Jobs’s introduction of Aqua for the umpteenth time, I still find it enthralling. I found Alan Dye’s introduction of Liquid Glass to be soporific, if not downright horseshitty.</p>

<p>But the work itself, Liquid Glass as it launched last week, is very reminiscent of Aqua a quarter century (!) ago. It’s exciting, it’s fresh, it fundamentally looks and feels very cool in general — and but in practice quite a few aspects of it feel a bit over-the-top and/or half-baked. Just like with Aqua, it will surely get dialed in. Legibility problems will be addressed.</p>

<p>Liquid Glass has been in the works for a long time, but what we see today has come together very quickly. For those using internal builds inside Apple, what Apple unveiled last week is effectively the third version of Liquid Glass. Just a few weeks prior to WWDC, a few sources told me that internal builds were such a complete mess that they wondered if it would come together in time for WWDC developer betas. But come together it has. I expect a <em>lot</em> of visual changes over the course of the summer, and significant evolutionary tweaks in the next few years. Across Apple’s own apps, there are a lot of places where things haven’t yet been glassed up at all. That’s how these things work.</p>

<p>As for <em>why</em>, it should be enough to justify Liquid Glass simply for the sake of looking cool. I opened this piece with a quote from a great fictional philosopher. I’ll close it with a quote from a great real one:</p>

<p>“<em>The test of a work of art is, in the end, our affection for it, not our ability to explain why it is good.</em>” <br />
—Stanley Kubrick</p>

<p>Peter Kafka:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So in March, when Gruber announced that Something is Rotten in the
State of Cupertino — focusing on Apple’s botched plans to imbue
its ailing Siri service with state-of-the-art AI — lots of people
paid attention. Including, apparently, folks at the very top of
the Apple org chart.</p>

<p>I talked to Gruber about the fallout from that post. Which is
pretty interesting! But there’s a lot more going on in this
conversation. It’s partly about the friction Apple has been
generating lately — not just about its AI efforts, but the way it
runs its App Store, and the way it interacts with developers — and why all of that does and doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>And it’s also about the delightfully retro practice of running an
ad-supported blog in 2025. That works very well for Gruber, but it
seems like the new Grubers of the world are doing their work on
YouTube or Substack. He’s got some thoughts about that, too.</p>

	</author>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Nicolas Lellouche, writing for the French-language site Numerama (block quote below is from Safari’s English translation) (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/18/apple-on-iphone-mirroring-still-not-in-eu/">via Joe Rossignol at MacRumors</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the problem with Europe? Apple does not explain it very
clearly, but suggests that the European Union’s requests for
opening create uncertainties. It is likely that the brand suspects
Europe of forcing it to open macOS to devices other than the
iPhone if this function were to happen. A mandatory iPhone
Mirroring on Windows or an Android Mirroring on Mac may not be in
his plans. The other probability is the question of gatekeepers,
raised in 2024. Apple would fear that macOS will be on the list of
monitored platforms if it can emulate iOS, one of the gatekeepers
monitored by Europe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem isn’t about MacOS getting flagged as another “gatekeeping” platform under the DMA. Whether or not Apple enables iPhone Mirroring on MacOS in the EU would have no bearing on whether the Mac is deemed a gatekeeper. The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32022R1925">DMA defines a “gatekeeper” platform</a> as “a core platform service that in the last financial year has at least 45 million monthly active end users established or located in the Union and at least 10,000 yearly active business users established in the Union”. I’m not sure how many Mac users there are in the EU, but I’m pretty sure the number is well under 45 million. (<a href="https://www.spyhunter.com/shm/macos-stats/">Estimates</a> seem to peg the worldwide number of Mac users at just over 100 million.) Conversely, if the European Commission decided that there <em>were</em> 45 million Mac users in the EU, the Mac would be considered a gatekeeping platform, period.</p>

<p>The problem is simply that the iPhone <em>is</em> a gatekeeping platform, and iPhone Mirroring obviously involves the iPhone. The EU’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/apple_appeals_eu_interop_requirements">recent demands regarding “interoperability requirements”</a> flag just about every single feature that involves an iPhone communicating with another Apple device. AirDrop, AirPlay, AirPods pairing, Apple Watch connectivity — all of that has been deemed illegal gatekeeping. Clearly, iPhone Mirroring would fall under the same interpretation, thus, iPhone Mirroring isn’t going to be available in the EU. If the DMA had been in place 15 years ago, the EU wouldn’t have AirDrop or AirPlay and perhaps wouldn’t have Apple Watch or AirPods, either.</p>

<p>If Apple made iPhone Mirroring available in the EU now, my guess is the European Commission would add it to the interoperability requirements list, and demand that Apple support mirroring your iPhone to all other platforms, such as Windows and Android. They might also demand that Apple add support to iOS for third-party screen mirroring protocols.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Several weeks ago, Apple indicated that other new products may be
blocked in Europe in the future. What about what’s new in iOS 26?
Apple is not commenting at the moment, since it must verify the
compatibility of its new functions with the European Union. Some
new features, such as the Phone application on Mac to make calls
with your iPhone, seem difficult to be compatible with the vision
of Europe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new Phone app on MacOS is almost certainly not coming to the EU, unless the European Commission changes its stance on these interoperability requirements.</p>

<p>John Voorhees, writing at MacStories, regarding a new command-line transcription tool cleverly named <a href="https://github.com/finnvoor/yap">Yap</a> written by his son Finn last week during WWDC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the way, Finn filled me in on a new class in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech">Apple’s Speech
framework</a> called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech/speechanalyzer">SpeechAnalyzer</a> and its
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech/speechtranscriber">SpeechTranscriber</a> module. Both the class and module are
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/277">part of Apple’s OS betas</a> that were released to developers
last week at WWDC. My ears perked up immediately when he told me
that he’d tested SpeechAnalyzer and SpeechTranscriber and was
impressed with how fast and accurate they were. [...]</p>

<p>What stood out above all else was Yap’s speed. By harnessing
SpeechAnalyzer and SpeechTranscriber on-device, the command line
tool tore through the 7GB video file a full 2.2× faster than
MacWhisper’s Large V3 Turbo model, with no noticeable difference
in transcription quality.</p>

<p>At first blush, the difference between 0:45 and 1:41 may seem
insignificant, and it arguably is, but those are the results for
just one 34-minute video. Extrapolate that to running Yap against
the hours of Apple Developer videos released on YouTube with the
help of <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp"><code>yt-dlp</code></a>, and suddenly, you’re talking about a
significant amount of time. Like all automation, picking up a 2.2×
speed gain one video or audio clip at a time, multiple times each
week, adds up quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s Foundation Models sure seem to be the sleeper hit from WWDC this year. This bodes very well for all sorts of use cases where transcription would be helpful, like third-party podcast players.</p>

<p>Bungie:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media
and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear. We’ve taken
this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft <em>Marathon</em>
into the game that truly reflects your passion. After much
discussion within our Dev team, we’ve made the decision to delay
the September 23rd release.</p>

<p>The Alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and
focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling — survival under pressure, mystery and lore around every
corner, raid-like endgame challenges, and Bungie’s
genre-defining FPS combat.</p>

<p>We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense,
high-stakes experience that a title like <em>Marathon</em> is built
around. This means deepening the relationship between the
developers and the game’s most important voices: our players.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Translation to plain English: <em>The game as currently imagined stinks, so we’re going back to the drawing board. We can’t explain why we, the game’s developers, didn’t know that it stunk, and instead seemingly needed to wait for scathing alpha test feedback from players — but Occam’s Razor clearly suggests the problem is that decisions at Bungie are made by executives with no taste.</em></p>

<p>Apple executives were a little light on substantial interviews last week, but a good one dropped today — Craig Federighi talking to Federico Viticci on the vast Mac-style windowing overhaul in iPadOS 26:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We don’t want to create a boat car or, you know, a spork”,
Federighi begins. Seeing the confused look on my face, he
continues: “I don’t know if you have those in Italy. Someone said,
<em>“If a spoon’s great, a fork’s great, then let’s combine them into
a single utensil, right?”</em> It turns out it’s not a good spoon and
it’s not a good fork. It’s a bad idea. And so we don’t want to
build sporks”. [...]</p>

<p>By and large, one could argue that Apple <em>has</em> created one such
convertible product with the iPad Pro, but Federighi strongly
believes in the Mac and iPad each having their own reasons to
exist. “The Mac lets the iPad be iPad”, Federighi notes, adding
that Apple’s objective “has not been to have iPad completely
displace those places where the Mac is the right tool for the
job”. [...]</p>

<p>I don’t need to ask Federighi the perennial question of running
macOS on the iPad, since he goes there on his own. “I don’t think
the iPad should run macOS, but I think the iPad can be <em>inspired</em>
by elements of the Mac”, Federighi tells me. “I think the Mac can
be inspired by elements of iPad, and I think that that’s happened
a great deal”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Apple has tied itself into knots in the past decade trying to make the iPad more useful to more advanced users without making it resemble the Mac at a superficial level. But it’s been obvious all along that it <em>should</em> resemble the Mac at a superficial level. Apple solved windowing in 1984. Use that.</p>

<p>You may recall from my “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber#fn3-2025-01-23">Siri Is Super Dumb and Getting Dumber</a>” piece back in January that the Dickinson Public Schools District in North Dakota had the rather unfortunate nickname the “Midgets”. Back in March, <a href="https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/dickinson-high-to-retire-midgets-mascot-after-nearly-a-century">the school district announced they’d be retiring the nickname</a>, after nearly a century. Last month <a href="https://www.dickinson.k12.nd.us/our-district/news/1810076/a-new-era-students-choose-dickinson-mavericks">they announced their new name</a>: the Mavericks. I’m going to call this the best rebranding of the year.</p>

<p>We still have <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/education/2024/11/19/estherville-lincoln-central-school-district-says-no-to-name-change/76333861007/">the Estherville, Iowa Midgets</a> to cheer for. But even better: <a href="https://yumahs.yumaunion.org/about-us/our-history">the Yuma Criminals in Arizona</a>. Now that’s a nickname.</p>

<p>Simon Willison, regarding the various rebuttals to “<a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking">The Illusion of Thinking</a>” research paper (which <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/08/apple-research-lrms">I linked to here</a>) from Apple’s machine learning team:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I thought this paper got <em>way</em> more attention than it warranted — the title “The Illusion of Thinking” captured the attention of the
“LLMs are over-hyped junk” crowd. I saw enough well-reasoned
rebuttals that I didn’t feel it worth digging into.</p>

<p>And now, notable LLM skeptic Gary Marcus has saved me some time by
aggregating the best of those rebuttals <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/seven-replies-to-the-viral-apple">together in one
place</a>! [...]</p>

<p>And therein lies my disagreement. I’m not interested in whether or
not LLMs are the “road to AGI”. I continue to care only about
whether they have useful applications today, once you’ve
understood their limitations. [...] They’re already useful to me
today, whether or not they can reliably solve the Tower of Hanoi
or River Crossing puzzles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Count me in with Willison. I think it’s <em>interesting</em> what constitutes “reasoning”, but when it comes to these systems, I’m mostly just interested in whether they’re useful or not, and if so, how.</p>

<p>WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum, back in 2012 (two years before Facebook <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/facebook-to-buy-messaging-start-up/">acquired them for $19 billion</a>, 13 years before this week’s introduction of ads into WhatsApp):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Advertising isn’t just the disruption of aesthetics, the insults
to your intelligence and the interruption of your train of
thought. At every company that sells ads, a significant portion of
their engineering team spends their day tuning data mining,
writing better code to collect all your personal data, upgrading
the servers that hold all the data and making sure it’s all being
logged and collated and sliced and packaged and shipped out... And
at the end of the day the result of it all is a slightly different
advertising banner in your browser or on your mobile screen.</p>

<p>Remember, when advertising is involved <em>you the user</em> are the
product.</p>

<p>At WhatsApp, our engineers spend all their time fixing bugs,
adding new features and ironing out all the little intricacies in
our task of bringing rich, affordable, reliable messaging to every
phone in the world. That’s our product and that’s our passion.
Your data isn’t even in the picture. We are simply not interested
in any of it.</p>

<p>When people ask us why we charge for WhatsApp, we say “Have you
considered the alternative?”</p>

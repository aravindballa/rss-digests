<p>Matthew Dowd, in a long, devastatingly careful post on Twitter/X:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If they’re suggesting their waveguide displays are bright enough
and vibrant enough to see clearly in direct sunlight, that would
be yet another innovation they’ve discovered that every other
player in the market (including the Chinese manufacturers where
the waveguide displays come from) has missed.</p>

<p>Meta has access to every display manufacturer and their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-Ban_Meta?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Display
Glasses’ peak brightness is ~5,000 nits</a>, itself very power
heavy. These glasses came out just last fall and there is no sign
of significantly brighter waveguides shipping for commercial
products since then. It’s also worth noting that Meta Display
Glasses users have <a href="https://www.jotme.io/blog/meta-ray-ban-display">noted poor readability in direct
sunlight</a>, suggesting a greater leap would be necessary to
meet Pickle’s claims.</p>

<p>Put simply, Pickle having much brighter waveguides that also have
a 30-degree FOV is extremely unlikely. It would mean that some
waveguide manufacturer out there (there aren’t many) recently
achieved a breakthrough and has chosen Pickle to be the first
device it’s found in. Oh, and it’s going to ship next quarter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know what these scammers at Pickle think is going to happen, but they sure as shit aren’t going to ship a product that does anything vaguely close to what they claim they’re on the cusp of shipping. I doubt they’re going to ship anything at all, ever. The whole thing is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie">the Big Lie</a>, but for technology not politics.</p>

<p>One of two scenarios is true:</p>

<ol type= "a">
<li><p>Pickle, <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/pickle-2">a 15-person startup founded in 2024</a> that has raised less than $10 million, is the most advanced personal computer hardware company in the world, on the cusp of launching multiple hardware and software technologies that put the company 5-10 years ahead of established rivals like Apple, Meta, Samsung, Google, Sony, and Zeiss. The Pickle 1 glasses are the most amazing consumer electronics device since the original iPhone. CEO Daniel Park will go down in history as one of the most innovative leaders and inventors in the history of the world. Or:</p></li>
<li><p>Pickle is a complete and utter sham that is accepting $200 pre-orders for a product that exists only as a fabricated fake in its launch video. CEO Daniel Park is a liar and fraud, and, depending upon what they do with the pre-order payments they are now collecting, perhaps a thief.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Either (a) is mostly true or (b) is mostly true. Given that there exists not one single independent person other than Park himself who vouches that the Pickle 1 actually exists and functions in prototype form, I think it’s pretty obvious which scenario is the case. Which makes me wonder <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ji4cvzir2qdpALLHo/ycombinator-fraud-rates">what the hell is going on at Y Combinator</a> these days.</p>

	<summary type="text">I just love the chutzpah of these guys. They started with a good minimal launch product and are back two years later with what looks like a *much* better idea for a phone keyboard accessory. But they’re also now making their own whole goddamn phone.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Two years ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/04/clicks">I linked to</a> the then-new <a href="https://www.clicks.tech/collections/shop-all">Clicks keyboard case</a> — an iPhone case with a built-in BlackBerry-style hardware keyboard jutting out from the bottom. I wrote then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t know how much I’ll wind up using it but it looks fun,
useful, and clever — and I’m just a sucker for upstart indie
hardware projects. Clicks is even a great name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wound up not using it much at all. I never owned a smartphone with a hardware keyboard (I went straight from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber/3672937486/">this Nokia dumbphone</a> right to an iPhone), so I have neither muscle memory nor nostalgia for hardware phone keyboards. I wound up typing slower — much slower — with my Clicks keyboard case than I did using the on-screen keyboard. Plus the way the keyboard juts out from the bottom makes your phone, when encased, something more akin size-wise to a TV remote control. I’m glad I bought it, was happy to try it, but it just wasn’t for me.</p>

<p>The Clicks team — including co-founders Michael “MrMobile” Fisher and Kevin “CrackBerry” Michaluk — is out today with two <em>major</em> new products. The best place to start is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69VgtIJOtdQ">this nicely-done 12-minute keynote</a> introducing both products.</p>

<p>The first is an entire BlackBerry-style phone: <a href="https://clicksphone.com/communicator">Clicks Communicator</a>. It runs Android but ships with a custom launcher that emphasizes messaging and notifications, has a hardware mute switch, and a side button with a color-coded alert light they call the Signal LED. It’s set to ship “later this year” and will cost $500, but you can pre-order one today for just $400. It looks cool. They’re pitching Communicator as a second phone — less distracting, focused on messaging — but one that could be your primary phone if you want it to be. <a href="https://crackberry.com/clicks-communicator">CrackBerry Kevin has a whole write-up about it</a>. I have zero need for one but I kind of want one.</p>

<p>The second is the <a href="https://www.clicks.tech/powerkeyboard">Clicks Power Keyboard</a>. It’s a MagSafe-compatible battery back with a keyboard that slides out, underneath your phone. (Reminiscent of the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/palm+pre">Palm Pre</a>?) It’s a Bluetooth keyboard, and you can pair it with up to three devices. Examples they cite include pairing with an iPad, Apple TV, and, intriguingly, a Vision Pro. (I’d rather type with my thumbs on a device like this than peck at the virtual keyboard in VisionOS, I think.) This strikes me as a much better idea for a hardware phone keyboard accessory than a case. Cases need to be made per each device. A Clicks keyboard case for an iPhone 15 won’t fit an iPhone 16. Hell, a case for an iPhone 15 won’t even fit an iPhone 15 Pro. And here we are in January and Clicks still doesn’t have cases for the <s>iPhones 17 or</s> iPhone Air. [<strong>Update:</strong> My bad, they <em>do</em> have cases for <a href="https://www.clicks.tech/products/clicks-keyboard-for-iphone-17">the 17 models</a>.] But MagSafe and Bluetooth mean the same Clicks Power Keyboard will work with any modern iPhone — or Android phone. It’s shipping “in the spring” and will cost $110, but can be pre-ordered for a limited time for $80. It comes in one color, black (the correct color if you’re only going to offer one). I’m going to buy one of these for sure, even though I’m quite certain my thumbs haven’t gained any muscle memory for such keyboards since I abandoned my Clicks keyboard case. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7Uz1YZ5hQA">Fisher has a whole video about the Clicks Power Keyboard on his YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>I just love the chutzpah of these guys. They started with a good minimal launch product and are back two years later with what looks like a <em>much</em> better idea for a phone keyboard accessory. But they’re also now making their own whole goddamn phone. That’s going big, not going home.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>After posting <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/19/photoshop-1-source-code">a link</a> to the Computer History Museum’s <a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/adobe-photoshop-source-code/">release of the Photoshop 1.0 source code</a> last week, I spent some time paging through the original Photoshop manuals. I found a screenshot of the dialog box where you entered your serial number, and posted it to Mastodon, writing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re annoyed by something that is obviously wrong about this
dialog box from Photoshop 1.0, you’re my type of person. (Even
more so if, like me, you remember being annoyed by this at the
time, when you were entering your cracked SN.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a lovely thread it generated, replete with screenshots from early versions of the HIG.</p>

<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> I would eat my hat if Alan Dye knew what was wrong and gross about this dialog box. This is exactly the sort of <em>sweating the idiomatic usability details</em> thing that has frequently been wrong in Apple software in the last decade. The response from Dye and those in his cohort would be, I’d wager, to roll their eyes with a “<em>Who gives a shit what the UI guidelines were forty fucking years ago?</em>” dismissal. Here’s the thing. <em>Styles</em> have changed as time has marched on. Technical capabilities — screen resolution, color — have marched on. But the fundamental idioms of good Macintosh UI design are timeless (and many of them ought to apply to Apple’s other platforms). These idioms are like grammar. Slang changes. Language forever moves forward. But many important idioms are so fundamental they do not change. Styles and technical advances have advanced over time in filmmaking and print design too, but the basic principles of good cinema and graphic layout are timeless. Only a fool dismisses the collective knowledge passed down by those who came before us. </p>

<p>Matthew Walther, in an opinion piece last week for The New York Times (gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MAGA’s internal culture has always rewarded theatrical
confrontation over achievement. Boorishness commands attention,
and boors mistake attention for leverage. Pseudo-martyrdom becomes
an end in itself. Loyalty tests proliferate. Those who counsel
de-escalation find themselves subject to denunciation; prudential
disagreement is allowed to provide cover for rank bigotry.
Partisans celebrate one another for exacerbating tensions even
when exacerbation forecloses coalition building.</p>

<p>There is also a related problem: The Trumpist movement has
generated a lunatic array of semiautonomous online subcultures
that are largely indifferent to strategic considerations and
immune from political consequences while still exercising
influence over actors whose decisions are not so immune. The
disappearance of the informal gate-keeping function once performed
by conservative luminaries such as William F. Buckley Jr. is
probably permanent. In the absence of such authority, informed
argument exists alongside phony outrage, profiteering,
self-aggrandizement and saying things for the hell of it. The
result is not merely the radicalization that Mr. Buckley feared
but a kind of omnidirectional incoherence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“A kind of omnidirectional incoherence” is as perfect a description as I’ve seen regarding the whole Trumpist movement in this second administration.</p>

<p>Ruffin Prevost, writing at The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As everyone filed out, I repeated, in English, some of the
priest’s comments to my guide, Keiko Hatada, who taught English
for 30 years and has led custom tours of Tokyo for the past
decade. I wanted to make sure I had understood things correctly.</p>

<p>I recounted the priest’s admonition to set aside unwholesome
feelings of anger and greed, and work instead to show compassion
and generosity, as well as his reminder that his temple was still
accepting donations for those affected by the 2011 earthquake and
tsunami.</p>

<p>“You told me you didn’t speak Japanese,” my guide said, pleasantly
surprised.</p>

<p>Beyond a few basic greetings and food terms, I don’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote the following two years ago <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/09/airpods_pro_2_usbc">in my AirPods Pro 2 review</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new AirPods Pro are the best single expression of Apple as a
company today. Not the most important product, not the most
complicated, not the most essential. But the one that exemplifies
everything Apple is trying to do. They are simple, they are
useful, and they offer features that most people use and want.
Most people use headphones. A lot of people use them every day — in noisy environments. AirPods Pro are — for any scenario where
big over-ear-style headphones are impractical — the best
headphones in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was <em>before</em> Live Translation, a feature that until recently existed only in science fiction.</p>

<p>Bobby Allyn, reporting three weeks ago for NPR:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The developer of ICEBlock, an iPhone app that anonymously tracks
the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, has
sued the Trump administration for free speech violations after
Apple <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/03/nx-s1-5561999/apple-google-iceblock-app-removal">removed</a> the service from its app store under
demands from the White House.</p>

<p>The suit, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26360437-iceblock-complaint-as-filed/">filed on Monday </a> in federal court in
Washington, asks a judge to declare that the administration
violated the First Amendment when it threatened to criminally
prosecute the app’s developer and pressured Apple to make the app
unavailable for download, which the tech company did in October. [...]</p>

<p>To First Amendment advocates, the White House’s pressure campaign
targeting ICEBlock is the latest example of what’s known as
“jawboning,” when government officials wield state power to
suppress speech. The Cato Institute calls the practice “censorship
by proxy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good on developer Joshua Aaron for filing this suit and defending his work.</p>

	<summary type="text">Kubrick on the Icarus myth.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Randy Walters wrote a lovely little story, “<a href="https://satori.substack.com/p/christianes-gift">Christiane’s Gift</a>”, originally published back in 2012, about a visit to a Frankfurt museum hosting an exhibit from Stanley Kubrick’s personal archives in 2004. I toured the same exhibit <a href="https://www.thecjm.org/pages/57">at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco in 2016</a>; it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a31Gv0lPlAw">remarkable</a>. Included in the exhibit was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rZTrZwmMJ0">the famed ƒ/0.7 Zeiss lens</a> (designed for use by NASA for satellite photography in space) and the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/04/02/kubricks-lenses">jury-rigged Mitchell BNC camera Kubrick commissioned</a> so he could use that lens to shoot scenes by candlelight in <em>Barry Lyndon</em>.</p>

<p>In the preface to his story, Walters references this quote from Kubrick, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5KHGN76AFE">his acceptance speech</a> for the D.W. Griffith lifetime achievement award from the Director’s Guild of America in 1998:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve compared Griffith’s career to the Icarus myth, but at the
same time I’ve never been certain whether the moral of the Icarus
story should only be, as is generally accepted, “Don’t try to fly
too high,” or whether it might also be thought of as “Forget the
wax and feathers, and do a better job on the wings.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That Zeiss lens/Mitchell BNC was a better job on the wings.</p>

	<summary type="text">The image Tim Cook posted on Twitter/X (and which the Apple TV account retweeted) is ugly and awkward. It either *is* AI-generated slop or it looks like AI-generated slop for no artistic or thematic reason whatsoever.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Some follow-up on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/27/slopibus">the looks-like-AI-slop “painting”</a> Tim Cook <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/2003873311504130173">posted</a> on Twitter/X on Christmas Eve to promote the <em>Pluribus</em> season finale. <a href="https://apple.slashdot.org/story/25/12/28/2048225/did-tim-cook-post-ai-slop-in-his-christmas-message-promoting-pluribus">Slashdot contacted the credited artist</a>, Keith Thomson, and quoted this interaction with him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Slashdot: I just wanted to confirm that that’s your work... If it
is your work, can you say anything about what software you used
when creating the image?</p>

<p>Thomson: I’m unable to comment on specific client projects. In
general, I always draw and paint by hand and sometimes incorporate
standard digital tools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a non-denial denial that he used generative AI to create the image.</p>

<p><a href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/12/26/apple-tim-cook-christmas-art-ai-debate-keith-thomson/">Dwayne Cubbins at PiunikaWeb also contacted Keith Thomson and got this statement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The artist, Keith Thomson, responded to my request for a comment,
stating that they “always draw by hand and sometimes incorporate
standard digital tools.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the same non-denial denial, because “standard digital tools” might include generative AI.</p>

<p><a href="https://spyglass.org/apples-pluribus-ai/">MG Siegler wonders</a> if it’s a deliberate allegory to some of the themes from the show, writing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keith Thomson using AI to produce art that’s like Keith Thomson’s
art because it’s trained on Keith Thomson’s art. How’s that for a
mindfuck?</p>

<p>I’m sure I’m reading wayyyy too much into that tweet (and
retweet), but given <a href="https://spyglass.org/pluribus-as-ai-allegory/">my previous post about <em>Pluribus</em> as an AI
allegory</a>, I think it’s sort of interesting to think about
in that context.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MG’s posts have some spoilers re: <em>Pluribus</em>, so follow those links at your own risk. <em>Pluribus</em> is best enjoyed if you start watching it knowing as little about it as possible. But without spoiling anything, I think MG didn’t put enough <em>y</em>’s in the <em>wayyyy</em> in “I’m sure I’m reading wayyyy too much into that tweet”. There is no 3D chess being played here.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/16/oatmeal-ai-art">I wrote just a few months ago</a> that I firmly believe generative AI tools not only can be, but already <em>are</em>, used to create genuine art. My problem with AI slop isn’t the <em>AI</em>, it’s the <em>slop</em>. Whatever “standard digital tools” Keith Thomson used to create <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/milk-and-cookies-tim-cook-keith-thomson.png">this</a>, the result is a turd.</p>

<p><em>Pluribus</em>, among numerous other merits, is a beautifully filmed show. <a href="https://www.keiththomsonart.com/">Thomson’s published paintings</a> are beautiful. The image Tim Cook posted on Twitter/X (and which the Apple TV account retweeted) is ugly and awkward. It either <em>is</em> AI-generated slop or it looks like AI-generated slop for no artistic or thematic reason whatsoever. Occam’s razor would suggest the conclusion that it simply is AI-generated slop, and Keith Thomson suckered Apple into paying for it.</p>

<p>My thanks to Copilot Money for sponsoring last week at DF. Copilot is a personal finance app for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and they’ve always deeply believed in the value of embracing the design idioms and technical features of truly native apps for Apple platforms. Apple has noticed, awarding Copilot an <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copilot-track-budget-money/id1447330651#productRatings">App Store Editor’s Choice</a> and featuring Copilot earlier this year on Apple Developer <a href="https://developer.apple.com/articles/copilot-money/">for their use of Swift Charts</a>.</p>

<p>Copilot’s big news this week is they’ve launched a new web app, bringing access to Copilot from any device, anywhere. It’s designed with all the attention to detail — and concern for privacy and security — as their native apps.</p>

<p>Copilot Money brings all your spending, budgets, investments, and net worth into one organized dashboard, with intelligent categorization and insights that help you stay on track without spreadsheets or app-hopping. Designed to feel calm and intuitive, Copilot makes it easy to understand your finances across all your devices.</p>

<p>Copilot first sponsored DF back in 2021. My wife and I started using it then to track our finances, and we haven’t looked back. Copilot Money isn’t just better than anything we’d used before, it absolutely blew everything else away. It’s easy to connect to your financial accounts, and once you do, you don’t need to spend any effort at all to enter transactions. Copilot just tracks it all automatically, and most importantly, presents it to you in clear, intuitive ways. It’s so good. I’m not saying that because they sponsored DF last week — I’m saying that as a happy paying customer for over four years now.</p>

<p>Copilot is offering DF readers two months free with code <strong>DARING</strong>, plus 26% off your first year for a limited time, <a href="https://copilot.money/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_campaign=daringfireball_122225_web25&amp;utm_term=DARING">available through this link</a>.</p>

<p>Major update to Rogue Amoeba’s essential audio utility for the Mac. I’ve written about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/09/soundsource-5">versions 5</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/04/04/soundsource-4">and 4</a> previously, and everything I wrote then remains true. SoundSource remains the system-wide audio menu item that ought to be built into MacOS, giving you easy, intuitive control over every audio <em>device</em> (input and output), and easy, intuitive control over every <em>app</em> in which you play or record audio. That one seemingly-simple app does both those things is quite the remarkable design achievement. And aside from that usability, SoundSource remains an exemplar of UI design stylistically — distinctive and branded, while looking and feeling in every way like a standard Mac app.</p>

<p>New tentpole features in version 6 include fine-grained AirPlay support (e.g. route output from one app over AirPlay while leaving the rest of your system’s audio output local to your Mac), groups for output devices, and a new “Quick Configs” feature for saving and switching between, well, quick configurations. $49 for a new license, $25 to upgrade from a previous one.</p>

<p>The whole illustration is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/milk-and-cookies-tim-cook-keith-thomson.png">just weird looking</a>, for one thing. As for sloppy details, the tree is in soft focus but somehow has a crisp edge, the carton is labeled both “Whole Milk” and “Lowfat Milk”, and the “Cow Fun Puzzle” maze is just goofily wrong. (I can’t recall ever seeing a puzzle of any kind on a milk carton, because they’re waxy and hard to write on. It’s like a conflation of milk cartons and cereal boxes.)</p>

<p>[<strong>Update, 29 December:</strong> Turns out, the “lowfat” milk carton props from the actual show <a href="https://x.com/lionesspike/status/1999675978650648889">have the same mistake</a> with “whole milk” printed above. That doesn’t change that it’s a stupid mistake to copy, or that there are a slew of other telltale signs that the image was generated by AI.]</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/appletv/status/2003927243245203539">The Apple TV X account retweeted Cook</a>, and added a credit: “We thought you might like this festive artwork by Keith Thomson, made on MacBook Pro.”</p>

<p>Apple didn’t tag the “Keith Thomson” who supposedly created this artwork for them, but if it’s <a href="https://www.keiththomsonart.com/">this Keith Thomson</a>, Apple must have somehow fallen for a scam, because <em>that</em> Keith Thomson’s published paintings are wonderful. It does seem to be <a href="https://x.com/flyosity/status/2004010434844938312">that Keith Thomson’s signature</a> on Apple’s sloppy illustration, though. (I like a bunch of the paintings from that Keith Thomson, and love a few of them, but <a href="https://www.keiththomsonart.com/?itemId=id1bethwvp1f2b3fsm5np1sg5i9p50">this one in particular</a> feels like it was made just for me. It’s perfect.)</p>

If your dumb cousin who knows you’re an Apple nerd approaches you on Christmas and says “<em>Hey what’s going on at Apple, Bloomberg says it’s rats leaving a sinking ship over there?</em>” and you don’t feel like explaining, just tell him to watch this video. Just the perfect explanation.</p>

<p>Smart, fair video from Quinn Nelson on the gap that remains between iPadOS 26 and desktop OSes. I think it’s right that there is a gap there. Apple has the Macintosh, the best desktop/workstation platform in the industry. So whatever the ideal is for iPadOS, it ought to fall short of MacOS in terms of technical capabilities, and instead offer a degree of simplicity and can’t-screw-it-up-edness that the Mac can’t match. But, some of the limitations that remain in iPadOS are just frustrating. iPadOS 26 is a huge leap forward, and I think sets the stage for Apple to address those limitations.</p>

<p>From a 2023 report at The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sony highly confidential information about its PlayStation
business has just been revealed by mistake. As part of the FTC v.
Microsoft hearing, Sony supplied a document from PlayStation chief
Jim Ryan that includes redacted details on the margins Sony shares
with publishers, its <em>Call of Duty</em> revenues, and even the cost of
developing some of its games.</p>

<p>It looks like someone redacted the documents with a black Sharpie — but when you scan them in, it’s easy to see some of the
redactions. Oops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is sort of the exception that proves the rule <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/23/trump-doj-pdf-redactions">regarding redactions</a>. If you redact a document digitally, you have to know what to look for (e.g. metadata) to be certain you’ve redacted everything you want to redact. If you redact a document on paper, you can just look at it, with good light and sharp eyes.</p>

<p>CNN media analyst Brian Stelter, on Bluesky:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As “60 Minutes” finalized its “Inside CECOT” report last Thursday,
CBS sent the White House a request for comment. A WH spokesperson
responded within a few hours. The quote was not included in the
“60” report — so, judge for yourself whether it should have been
included or not.</p>

<p>WH spokesperson Abigail Jackson said “60 Minutes should spend
their time and energy amplifying the stories of Angel Parents,
whose innocent American children have tragically been murdered by
vicious illegal aliens that President Trump are removing from the
country.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the fact that it doesn’t address a single aspect of the report, 60 Minutes should have included that statement, both to reveal the belligerent callousness of the administration, and to highlight the glaring grammatical error. In its way, the statement speaks volumes.</p>

<p>Christopher Goffard, reporting for the Los Angeles Times (<a href="https://apple.news/AC4dB7O1XRLmMK5alJLphRg">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When police questioned Marvin Margolis following the murder of
Elizabeth Short — who became known as the Black Dahlia — he lied
about how well he had known her. The 22-year-old Short had been
found mutilated in a weedy lot in South Los Angeles, severed
neatly in half with what detectives thought was surgical skill.</p>

<p>Margolis was on the list of suspects. He was a sullen 21-year-old
premed student at USC, a shell-shocked World War II veteran who
had expressed an eagerness to practice surgery. He was “a
resentful individual who shows ample evidence of open aggression,”
a military psychiatrist had concluded.</p>

<p>At first, Margolis did not tell detectives that he had lived with
Short for 12 days at a Hollywood Boulevard apartment, three months
before her January 1947 murder. [...]</p>

<p>A generation later and hundreds of miles north, a killer who
called himself the Zodiac terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area
with five seemingly random murders from 1968 to 1969, taunting
police and media for years with letters and cryptograms.</p>

<p>The toughest to decipher was the letter he sent in April 1970 to
the San Francisco Chronicle, with the words “My name is —”
followed by a 13-character string of letters and symbols. It came
to be called the Z13 cipher, and its brevity has stymied
generations of PhDs and puzzle prodigies.</p>

<p>Alex Baber, a 50-year-old West Virginia man who dropped out of
high school and taught himself codebreaking, now says he has
cracked the Zodiac killer’s identity — and in the process solved
the Black Dahlia case as well.</p>

<p>“It’s irrefutable,” said Baber, obsessive, hyperfocused and
cocksure in manner, his memory encyclopedic and his speech a
firehose of dates, locations and surprising linkages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a story. The circumstantial evidence pointing to Margolis seems pretty strong. What I can’t find is an explanation of Baber’s solution to the Z13 cypher. The “irrefutable” description hinges on that. There’s a new podcast, “<a href="https://killerinthecode.com/">Killer in the Code</a>”, from author Michael Connelly that details Baber’s supposed solution tying both cases to the same guy. All the publicity about this today stems from the debut of that podcast yesterday.</p>

<p>Everyone who works with official PDFs in any capacity should know that if you start with a PDF containing text you want to redact, and you just place black bars atop that text and resave the file, the original text is all still there in the new PDF file. It’s the digital equivalent of putting sticky notes atop the text. You don’t even need to crack open the new PDF in a text (or hex) editor and hunt for the original text within non-human-readable PDF formatting code. You just open the PDF in Preview or Acrobat or any other PDF viewer, use the regular text selection cursor to select the text under the black bars, copy, and then paste into any other app. Everyone should know this but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/16/meta-redactions">it keeps happening</a>. Now <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@krassenstein/video/7586804140869700895">it’s happened</a> with the new batch of Epstein files released by the DOJ.</p>

<p>There are <em>major</em> differences between the Trump 1.0 and 2.0 administrations. In the Trump 1.0 administration, many of the most important officials were very competent men. One example would be then-Attorney General William Barr. Barr is contemptible, yes, but smart AF. When Barr’s DOJ released a redacted version of the Mueller Report, they printed the whole thing, made their redactions with actual ink, and then re-scanned every page <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/05/02/mueller-pdf-assessment">to generate a new PDF with absolutely no digital trace of the original PDF file</a>. There are ways to properly redact a PDF digitally, but going analog is foolproof.</p>

<p>The Trump 2.0 administration, in contrast, is staffed top to bottom with fools.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Lopatto, back in October, after Bari Weiss was first named editor-in-chief of CBS News by David Ellison after his acquisition of Paramount:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the glass cliff to end all glass cliffs. You’re Marissa
Mayer at Yahoo without the Googler street cred. You’re Nancy Dubuc
at Vice without the string of hit TV shows. You’re Linda Yaccarino
at Twitter without the advertiser relationships. You have been
hired as a sop to a Trump administration that is actively hostile
to the <em>actual</em> free press, and you will be made to oversee wave
after wave of layoffs until you quit or get fired and the entire
news division is shut down in a final spasm of cost-cutting after
the next inescapable media merger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only thing Lopatto missed in her prescient piece is that Weiss might not last long enough to still be leading CBS News by the time Ellison gets to layoffs. It’s simply untenable for a partisan propagandist to be leading a legitimate news organization. Two months into the job and Weiss has already made a complete fool of herself. Her ham-fisted (but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/22/60-minutes-cecot-samizdat">failed</a>) attempt to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/22/weiss-60-minutes-cecot">censor a fair and well-reported piece</a> critical of the Trump administration’s deportation policies comes just one week after a televised town hall with Erika Kirk (widow of Charlie Kirk), which Weiss herself hosted, for which <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/advertisers-wary-cbs-news-bari-weiss-town-hall-1236608265/">the commercial spots were filled by direct marketing dietary supplements</a> and, I swear, Chia Pets.</p>

<p>It’s been an inauspicious two months on the job for Weiss, to say the least.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Lopatto, writing at The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>60 Minutes had already begun promoting the now-censored segment
online. Because it was pulled so late, it seems that CBS missed at
least one platform for distribution: Canada’s Global TV. Some
people used a VPN to watch it; at least one person recorded it,
distributing it through an iCloud account.</p>

<p>The segment, which has been reviewed by The Verge, is a little shy
of 14 minutes long. It features video of men, chained and bent
double, being “paraded in front of cameras, pushed onto buses, and
delivered to CECOT,” according to the segment’s narration. One
former detainee, who CBS met in Colombia, said he was told he was
“the living dead” at CECOT. After trying to seek asylum in the US,
he says he was detained by customs and held for 6 months before
being deported. He described horrific conditions at the prison,
saying he was beaten until he bled and that he was thrown into a
wall so hard he broke one of his teeth. He also described sexual
assault by the guards. Another interviewed former detainee
described what can only be called torture: being forced to kneel
for 24 hours, and being put in a dark room, where they were beaten
if they moved from the stress position. [...]</p>

<p>Anyway, best of luck to Weiss in playing DMCA whack-a-mole with
the video of the story. The segment lives as online samizdat now.
Thanks to Weiss’ censorship, it may very well wind up being the
most-talked-about CBS News story this year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a bunch of copies on social media, but <a href="https://www.muellershewrote.com/p/watch-the-60-minutes-cecot-segment">most are video of the TV broadcast in Canada shot from an iPhone</a>. The Internet Archive, however, has <a href="https://archive.org/details/60minutes-cecotsegment">a clean copy that’s a direct screen recording</a>. Watch for yourself.</p>

<p>In addition to being the most-talked-about CBS News story of the year, it’ll almost certainly be the most-watched. But CBS will get none of the views or ad revenue. There’s no better way to make people want to watch something than to tell them they shouldn’t watch it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Streisand_effect_examples">The Streisand effect</a> is very real.</p>

<p>David Folkenflik, reporting for NPR:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just a day and a half before it was set to be broadcast, new CBS
News Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss pulled a planned 60 Minutes
investigative segment centering on allegations of abuses at an El
Salvador detention center where the Trump administration sent
hundreds of Venezuelan migrants last March.</p>

<p>Weiss told colleagues this weekend the piece — planned for Sunday
night’s show — could not run without an on-the-record comment
from an administration official. She pushed for 60 Minutes to
interview Stephen Miller, senior advisor to President Trump, or
someone of his stature. That’s according to two people with
knowledge of events at the network who spoke on condition of
anonymity, citing job security.</p>

<p>The correspondent on the story, Sharyn Alfonsi, condemned the
decision in an email to 60 Minutes colleagues on Sunday evening,
saying she believed it was “not an editorial decision, it is a
political one.” [...] Alfonsi wrote that she and her colleagues on
the story had sought comments and interviews from the Department
of Homeland Security, the White House and the State Department.</p>

<p>“Government silence is a statement, not a VETO,” Alfonsi wrote in
the email. “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes
a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a
‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not surprising in the least bit that Weiss tried to censor a jarring report on Trump’s illegal torture prison in El Salvador. It is, perhaps, slightly surprising how dumb this attempt is. Of course it’s a good principle of journalism to allow the other side of a story to comment or be interviewed. But the idea that the other side can just decline to participate and that means you can’t run the story is like fingers-in-your-ears “I can’t hear you!” playground nonsense. You run the story and say that they declined to comment.</p>

<p>It’s not just that Weiss kiboshed a solid piece of reporting from 60 Minutes. It’s that the editor-in-chief of CBS News is now on the record as saying that the entire staff of 60 Minutes wanted to run an unfair hit piece on the Trump administration. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/07/curse_not_the_king_cbs_colbert_trump">The decline of CBS</a> as an institution continues.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My thanks to Finalist for sponsoring last week at Daring Fireball. Finalist is a remarkable, ambitious, and novel app for iPhone, iPad, and the Mac from indie developer Slaven Radic. It’s a planner — a digital take on traditional paper planners. Its motto: “Most productivity apps help you organize tasks. Finalist helps you finish them.”</p>

<p>One aspect of Finalist that makes it different from most to-do/task apps is that instead of setting due dates for tasks, you add tasks to specific days. This <em>really</em> resonates with me. With most apps in this domain, the top-level items are tasks, and tasks have (optional) due dates. With Finalist, the top-level items are <em>days</em>, and days have tasks and events. This might sound like I’m splitting semantic hairs but it gives Finalist a very different feel, one that’s more natural to me. If you’ve got unfinished items from yesterday, Finalist lets you move them all forward to today with one tap. Or, move some forward, and leave others behind. Or, just leave them all behind and move on. Up to you. I like that.</p>

<p>Finalist integrates with the system in all the ways you’d hope, including with the system calendar APIs and the Reminders app. So events in your system calendar and items from Reminders show up on your days in Finalist. Finalist lets you create events (calendar items), reminders (to-dos that are synced with Reminders), tasks (to-dos that exist only in Finalist), journal entries (like notes to yourself), and section headers if you have a busy day and need to group certain items together. Oh, and “habits”, too — recurring to-dos for habits you want to build or break. It sounds like a lot, but it all fits together neatly, covering the gamut of stuff you’d track in a daily paper planner. And everything in Finalist syncs between platforms (iPhone, iPad, Mac) with iCloud. There’s no account to create — it just uses iCloud, which is private and simple.</p>

<p>It’s not minimalist, but it’s not complicated. I’ve had a lot of fun learning to use Finalist just by exploring it. It’s thoughtful and intuitive. Like any civilized app, Finalist’s tags allow you to include spaces and capital letters in tag names, and don’t start with a stupid <code>#</code> character. And, design-wise, Finalist is very handsome — it offers customizable color themes and makes terrific use of the typographic features of the San Francisco system font.</p>

<p>Subscriptions cost $5/month or $30/year. A lifetime license costs just $60. It supports Family Sharing too.</p>

<p>I’m kind of blown away by how robust and thoughtful Finalist is. It’s not a web app with iOS and Mac clients. It’s a suite of native apps designed with care for Apple’s platforms. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/01/27/auteur-theory-of-design">Auteur software</a>, with a distinctive brand and vision, while remaining idiomatically native. Bravo to Slaven Radic. <a href="https://finalist.works/df">I strongly encourage you to check it out</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/12/17/apple-announces-sweeping-app-store-and-iphone-changes-in-japan/">Chance Miller, reporting for 9to5Mac this week</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To comply with the <a href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/file/MSCA_Guidelines_tentative_translation.pdf">Mobile Software Competition Act
(MSCA)</a>, Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-in-japan/">announced</a> a set of major
changes to the App Store and iPhone in Japan. The changes include
new app distribution options for developers and new alternative
payment rules for the App Store.</p>

<p>Apple announced the changes in a post on <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-in-japan/">Apple Newsroom
today</a> and on its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/app-distribution-in-japan/">developer website</a>. The
company says that Japan’s “MSCA’s requirements for alternative
app marketplaces and app payments open new avenues for malware,
fraud and scams, and privacy and security risks.” Nonetheless,
the company has collaborated with Japanese regulators to strike
as best a balance as possible to comply with the law and
protect users.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, Apple says Japan’s MSCA does a better job of
balancing openness with security and user protection than the DMA
in the EU. For example, Apple does not have to support app
downloads from the web in Japan like it does under the DMA. Apple
retains ability to protect users from malware and other security
risks. This is especially true when it comes to protecting
children, as outlined below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Developers in Japan can now offer their own payment processing within their apps and games, and offer link-outs to the web, but these options must be offered alongside the option to pay using Apple’s own in-app purchase system. Developers are allowed to offer lower prices in alternative payment methods. That strikes me as a decent, but not ideal balance. I think it’s fair for Apple to mandate that its own IAP be offered alongside any form of alternative payment within an app. But, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/coming_to_grips_with_apples_seemingly_unshakable_sense_of_app_store_entitlement">as I’ve long advocated</a>, links to the web — leaving the app for the system’s default browser — should be permitted without having to offer IAP too. But overall, where Japan landed is reasonable.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/17/japan-app-store-feature-updates/">From Juli Clover’s report on Apple’s MSCA compliance</a> at MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s a quick rundown of what’s changing as of today:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Side Button</strong> — Users in Japan will be able to change what
the side button does, and it will be able to activate
third-party voice assistants instead of Siri.</li>
<li><strong>Payment options</strong> — Developers can offer in-app purchases,
accept third-party payments in their apps, or direct users to a
website to make a purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Alternative app marketplaces</strong> — Apps can be distributed
through alternative app marketplaces instead of the App Store.
Users can set an alternative app marketplace as their default
marketplace instead of the App Store.</li>
<li><strong>Fee changes</strong> — New fees range from 5% to 26% depending on
distribution method and payment method.</li>
<li><strong>Browser choice</strong> — Users are prompted to select a default
browser at setup.</li>
<li><strong>Search engine choice</strong> — Users are prompted to choose a
default Search engine at setup.</li>
<li><strong>Navigation apps</strong> — Users in Japan can select a different
navigation app.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-in-japan/">in its own announcement</a>, asserted its disagreement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The MSCA’s requirements for alternative app marketplaces and app
payments open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, and
privacy and security risks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course they disagree with Japan’s MSCA on some of these things. If Apple didn’t disagree, they’d implement these features worldwide, not make them specific to Japan. And since they’re not applying these compliance measures worldwide, it’s correct for Apple to explain why.</p>

<p>But on the whole, this is a gentlemen’s disagreement — a polite agreement to disagree, with Apple making their case but then implementing the necessary measures for compliance without complaint. A polite explanation that they see some of these measures as introducing privacy and security risks is not a complaint per se.</p>

<p>This is of a piece with Apple’s longstanding respect for and relationship with the Japanese government. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/01/apple-anti-steering-relaxation">Back in 2021</a>, Apple changed the rules for “reader” apps in Japan to allow linking to websites, in order to comply with a ruling from the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC). <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-commission-closes-app-store-investigation/">In Apple’s announcement</a>, App Store chief Phil Schiller said the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Trust on the App Store is everything to us. The focus of the App
Store is always to create a safe and secure experience for users,
while helping them find and use great apps on the devices they
love,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow who oversees the App
Store. “We have great respect for the Japan Fair Trade Commission
and appreciate the work we’ve done together, which will help
developers of reader apps make it easier for users to set up and
manage their apps and services, while protecting their privacy and
maintaining their trust.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can search, but you won’t find quotes from Schiller, nor any other Apple representatives, speaking of their “great respect for” and appreciation of the work they’ve done together regarding the European Commission and the DMA. Chance Miller, in his above-linked report at 9to5Mac, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/12/17/apple-announces-sweeping-app-store-and-iphone-changes-in-japan/">wrote</a>, “Apple says Japan’s MSCA does a better job of balancing openness with security and user protection than the DMA in the EU.” I was in the same briefing with Apple representatives as Miller, and I’d say Apple was more clear than that. In addition to seeing the MSCA as more aligned with Apple’s own priorities regarding privacy and security than the DMA, Apple repeatedly emphasized that the MSCA respected Apple’s intellectual property in ways that the DMA does not. Complying with the DMA is adversarial and obtuse. An Apple spokesperson confirmed that, in contrast with the DMA, the guidelines that accompany the MSCA provide more clarity on things like privacy, security, safety, and youth protection. (E.g. apps distributed outside the App Store in Japan still require age ratings. There’s no such requirement in the EU.)</p>

<p>Because of the DMA, Apple has delayed and outright withheld major features in the EU. iPhone Mirroring, one of Apple’s best new features in recent years, is still unavailable in the EU. Apple fully expects more features to be delayed or  withheld from the EU as time goes on. (With Apple Watch, they’ve now been forced to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/11/apple_eu_dma_iphone_accessories_wi-fi_sync">remove (or perhaps better said, hamstring) a feature</a> that existed since Apple Watch debuted in 2015.) There have been no such feature delays (let alone withholdings) in Japan, nor does Apple expect there to be. The MSCA targets specific issues related to competition: how iOS apps are distributed, and how they are monetized. The MSCA choice-screen mandates for web browsers and search engines are clear, and don’t impose any odious or particularly confusing obstacles to users.<sup id="fnr1-2025-12-20"><a href="#fn1-2025-12-20">1</a></sup> Apple has made clear that they don’t agree with every aspect of the MSCA, but if you read between the lines, you can see a begrudging acknowledgement from Apple that the MSCA is well-intended, clear, and attempts to strike a balance between user experience, privacy, and security; respect for Apple’s intellectual property; and the anticompetitive aspects of Apple’s control over app distribution and payments that the law was written to address.</p>

<p>There is a mutual respect here between Apple and Japan that is completely absent between Apple and the European Commission. The MSCA, through its focus and clarity, is also more respectful of <em>users</em>. Users in Japan get the benefit of alternative app distribution (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/18/altstore-japan-launch/">AltStore is already there</a>) and alternative payment options with no trade-offs like delayed or withheld features. It’s hard to find anything aside from small nits to complain about in the MSCA. It arguably gives Japanese users a better, more robust iOS experience than what Apple offers to the rest of the world.<sup id="fnr2-2025-12-20"><a href="#fn2-2025-12-20">2</a></sup> The DMA, in contrast, has given EU users a worse iOS experience.</p>

<p>It’s the practical results of legislation and regulation that matter, not the intentions. The Japanese government seemingly gets that, and acts accordingly.</p>

<li id="fn1-2025-12-20">
<p>I think these mandatory choice screens are rather stupid. They have not proven to be effective in Europe. They’re a feel-good mandate for bureaucrats. <em>Look, here’s a whole screen that we have forced upon every single user — visible, unavoidable proof that we have done something. Who cares whether most people do not know what a “default browser” is, or what a “search engine” is? We’ll make them pick anyway.</em> The end result is that nothing has changed in terms of browser or search engine market share. All they’ve really accomplished is to make first-run onboarding time slightly longer. But — so long as users aren’t forced to face these choice screens repeatedly, they’re only a minor irritation. They’re like a mandatory “you should wear a helmet” warning label on a skateboard. You peel it off and throw it away, and the percentage of skateboarders who wear a helmet remains unchanged.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-12-20"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<p>If we had alternative iOS app marketplaces in the US, like they do in the EU and now have in Japan, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/10/iceblock_removed_from_app_store">ICEBlock</a> might still be available for download. I say <em>might</em> because it’s impossible to know whether Apple would attempt to stymie ICEBlock at the notarization level, given <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/tag/notarization/">some of the cases</a> where they’ve <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/06/14/utm-blocked-outside-app-store-via-notarization/">used notarization to block apps in the EU</a>. But if alternative app marketplaces were available in the US, ICEBlock certainly <em>should</em> still be available. Really, it should still be available in the App Store.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2025-12-20"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<p>The Computer History Museum:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thomas Knoll, a PhD student in computer vision at the University
of Michigan, had written a program in 1987 to display and modify
digital images. His brother John, working at the movie visual
effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic, found it useful for
editing photos, but it wasn’t intended to be a product. Thomas
said, “We developed it originally for our own personal use … it was
a lot a fun to do.”</p>

<p>Gradually the program, called “Display”, became more
sophisticated. In the summer of 1988 they realized that it indeed
could be a credible commercial product. They renamed it
“Photoshop” and began to search for a company to distribute it.
About 200 copies of version 0.87 were bundled by slide scanner
manufacturer Barneyscan as “Barneyscan XP”.</p>

<p>The fate of Photoshop was sealed when Adobe, encouraged by its art
director Russell Brown, decided to buy a license to distribute an
enhanced version of Photoshop. The deal was finalized in April
1989, and version 1.0 started shipping early in 1990.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Along with the 1.0 source code (mostly Pascal, with some 68K assembler), CHM has PDFs of Adobe’s excellent Photoshop 1.0 User Guide and Tutorial. CHM trustee Grady Booch, chief scientist for software engineering at IBM Research Almaden, on the source code:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are only a few comments in the version 1.0 source code, most
of which are associated with assembly language snippets. That
said, the lack of comments is simply not an issue. This code is so
literate, so easy to read, that comments might even have gotten in
the way. [...] This is the kind of code I aspire to write.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A little birdie who works at Adobe today told me, regarding the lack of comments, “Let me assure you, that trend continued for the next 35 years.”</p>

<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2025/12/adobe-photoshop-1-0-source-code-now-available/">Jason Snell, at Six Colors, notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only shame is that this release doesn’t include the code from
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacApp">MacApp applications library</a>, which Photoshop used
and is owned by Apple. It would sure be nice if Apple made that
code available as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Says my little birdie, “Turns out Adobe got a perpetual license to MacApp and a heavily modified version of it is <em>still</em> the basis of the UI code. It is only recently starting to get replaced. Even more crazy is that parts of that MacApp code are running on iOS and Android and the web versions.”</p>

<p>Quite the legacy for what started as a personal project between two brothers.</p>

<p>Yesterday I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the last 40 years Apple has only gone through three identity
fonts: Garamond → Myriad → San Francisco.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DF reader Cameron McKay emailed to observe: “It strikes me that Apple changes CPU architectures (68K → PowerPC → Intel → ARM) more often than identity fonts. They’d sooner re-engineer their products’ deepest technical building blocks than change typefaces. I suspect that’s rare among tech companies.”</p>

<p>I wish I’d thought to mention that yesterday.</p>

<p>I’ll add that I suspect San Francisco might effectively be Apple’s “forever font”. Forever is a long time, but San Francisco, in its default appearance, strives for the sort of timelessness that Helvetica achieved. And <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/">San Francisco offers</a> a wide (no pun intended) variety of widths and weights. <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-17-pro/">This is San Francisco</a>. <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-air/">This is too</a>. (Screenshots for posterity, when Apple’s website changes: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/san-fran-example-iphone-17-pro.jpeg">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/san-fran-example-iphone-air.jpeg">iPhone Air</a>.)</p>

<p>I also suspect that Apple Silicon is Apple’s “forever architecture”.</p>

	<summary type="text">I despise this design pattern, because it’s inherently slower than signing in using an email/password combination that was saved to my passwords app (which is Apple Passwords) and autofilled by my web browser. It’s not just a little slower but *a lot* slower.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>In Juli Clover’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/19/apples-262-os-updates">aforelinked</a> rundown of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-2-features/">what’s new across the whole system in iOS 26.2</a>, I misunderstood this item regarding the Passwords app:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the Settings section of the Passwords app, there’s an option to
manage websites where passwords are not saved when signing in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This new setting is about managing sites that you have previously excluded from having a password entry saved. (In the Settings app, go to Apps → Passwords and then tap “Show Excluded Websites”.)</p>

<p>What I was <em>hoping</em> this was about is a feature Passwords doesn’t have, but that I want. There are many sites — and the trend seems to be accelerating — that do not use passwords (or passkeys) for signing in. Instead, they only support signing in via expiring “magic links” sent by email (or, sometimes, via text messages). To sign in with such a site, you enter your email address, hit a button, and the site emails you a fresh link that you need to follow to sign in.<sup id="fnr1-2025-12-19"><a href="#fn1-2025-12-19">1</a></sup> I despise this design pattern, because it’s inherently slower than signing in using an email/password combination that was saved to my passwords app and autofilled by my web browser. My password manager is Apple Passwords and my browser is Safari, but this is true for any good password manager and web browser. It’s not just a little slower but a <em>lot</em> slower to sign in with a “magic link”. It sometimes takes minutes for the  email to arrive, and even in the best case, it takes at least 15 seconds or so. Saved-password autofill, on the other hand, happens <em>instantly</em>.<sup id="fnr2-2025-12-19"><a href="#fn2-2025-12-19">2</a></sup></p>

<p>To make matters worse, when you create a new account using a “magic link”, <em>nothing</em> gets saved to Apple Passwords. I don’t have many email addresses in active use, but I do have several. Sometimes I don’t remember which one I used for my account on a certain site. It doesn’t get autofilled by Apple Passwords because account entries in Apple Passwords require a password. I was hoping the above feature mentioned by Clover was a way to address this — that you could now enable a setting to get Passwords to save just your email address for websites and services that exclusively use “magic links” for signing in. No dice. Apple Passwords team, if you’re reading this, please give this some thought. I can’t be the only person irritated by this.</p>

<p>One workaround I’ve used for a few sites with which I keep running into this situation (<a href="https://www.status.news/">Status</a>, I’m looking in your direction) is to manually create an entry in Apple Passwords for the site with the email address I used to subscribe, and a made-up single-character password. Apple Passwords won’t let you save an entry without something in the password field, and a single-character password is a visual clue to my future self why I did this. When I do this, I also put a note to myself in the notes field for the entry. And by using just a single character for the made-up password, I can tell what I did even when the password is displayed using bullets to obscure its actual characters. (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/apple-passwords-magic-link-example.png">Screenshot</a>.) If you feel like I do about “magic links”, the 🖕 emoji is a good “password” for such entries. </p>

<p>Once saved like this, my email address still doesn’t autofill on such sites in Safari, but the list of my saved email addresses in the suggestion list that appears when I click in the Email text field will have a “saved password” label next to the one for which I made this entry in Apple Passwords. This at least solves the problem when I can’t remember which address I used to create my account on a site.</p>

<p>Better would be a way for Passwords to ask if you want to save just your email address for sites with “magic link” sign-ins, and then for Safari to autocomplete that address just like it does for username/password combinations. I can see how this would be a tricky problem for Apple Passwords to solve in a way that makes clear to the user why certain entries do not have passwords, but it’s a problem worth solving.</p>

<li id="fn1-2025-12-19">
<p>This design pattern is common with paywalled subscription content sites, like email newsletters, to cut down on password sharing. Let’s say someone pays $10/month for a subscription-based newsletter. If they can sign in using an email/password combination, they might be willing to share their email/password combination for that particular site with a few friends or colleagues, to give them access to the same paywalled content without paying for their own subscriptions. Same goes for sharing email/password combinations <a href="https://www.stuff.tv/features/netflix-password-sharing-what-to-do-about-the-steaming-services-crackdown/">for streaming services like Netflix</a>. Well, you can’t share a password if there is no password to share. If the only way to log in to a subscription-based account is via a magic link that expires within minutes, it’s a lot harder for person A to share their account with person B (let alone with persons C, D, E, and F — nor can persons B through F share the account with others, because they don’t have access to the email). Person B has to tell person A that they’re signing in again, then person A has to wait for the email to arrive, and then person B needs to wait for person A to copy and paste the “magic” link, and hope it arrives before it expires. This pattern adds a significant convenience cost to account sharing — but it also makes signing in more annoying for honest users who <em>aren’t</em> sharing their accounts.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-12-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<li id="fn2-2025-12-19">
<p>Proponents of “magic links” argue that they’re beneficial for technically befuddled users who don’t use a password manager. That’s a good argument for offering “magic links” as an <em>option</em>, but it’s not a good argument for making them the <em>exclusive</em> way to sign in to a site or service. Good password managers are built into modern OSes and web browsers. Those of us who use them should not be punished with a significantly worse experience just because some users do not. When “magic links” are offered as an <em>alternative</em> to a saved password or passkey, there’s a path for all users. When “magic links” are the <em>exclusive</em> method for signing in, all users get the slowest experience.</p>

<p>(And yes, <a href="https://passport.online/">Passport</a>, the subscription system behind <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a> and the rest of Ben Thompson’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/stratechery-plus/">Stratechery media empire</a>, exclusively uses “magic links” for sign-in. I don’t like it, but, in Passports’s defense, once you’re signed in, Passport keeps you signed in for a very long time. Other CMSes tend to expire sign-ins far too quickly, which makes for a particularly frustrating experience with “magic links” because you need to keep using them every few weeks.)&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2025-12-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<p>Apple released all of its OS 26.2 updates a week ago today. A little unusual for Apple to release OS updates on a Friday, but I think they wanted to get these out before Christmas week. And I don’t think it was rushed — for iOS 26.2 at least, there were two release candidate builds during beta testing. I suspect Apple had hoped to release them earlier.</p>

<p>I know it seemed weird back at WWDC when Apple announced that they were re-numbering all their OS versions to start with 26. But now that the change has settled in for a few months, it seems very natural. It’s so easy now to remember that the current major version for each OS is 26. It’s also easier to talk about new features that span across OSes. And, in the future, when you see a reference to, say, iOS 26, you’ll know exactly when that version came out without having to think, because it’s right there in the version number itself.</p>

<p>A few other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Juli Clover at MacRumors, as usual, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-2-features/">has a great rundown of what’s new across the whole system in iOS 26.2</a>, copiously illustrated with screenshots. Clover notes: “For pop-out menus that expand from a corner button, iOS 26.2 adds a quicker, bouncier animation that looks like the animation that Apple showed off at WWDC.” Popover menus are just one example, but this is actually true for a lot of Liquid Glass details. iOS 26.2 is the first release that visually delivers on most of what Apple showed in the WWDC keynote.</li>
<li><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/12/12/apple-releases-ios-26-2-with-liquid-glass-tweaks-carplay-changes-much-more/">Zac Hall has another good iOS 26.2 rundown, also illustrated, at 9to5Mac</a>.</li>
<li>Clover also notes that iOS 26.2, for some users (including me), <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/12/ios-26-2-automatic-software-update/">defaults to a first-run screen that encourages you to turn on automatic OS updates</a>. Pay attention if you don’t want that.</li>
<li><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/12/12/ipados-26-2-is-now-available-for-ipad-heres-everything-new/">A list of iPadOS 26.2 changes from Ryan Christoffel at 9to5Mac</a>.</li>
<li>Nadeem Sarwar at Digital Trends has a good piece showing <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/phones/ios-26-2-adds-an-airdrop-security-tool-that-you-shouldnt-ignore-on-your-iphone/">the new AirDrop code feature</a>, to allow AirDropping with people who aren’t in your contacts for up to 30 days.</li>
<li>MacOS 26.2 Tahoe changes, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/12/apple-releases-macos-tahoe-26-2/">from MacRumors</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/12/12/macos-tahoe-26-2-now-available-whats-new/">from 9to5Mac</a>.</li>
<li>Clover on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/12/apple-releases-tvos-26-2/">tvOS 26.2</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/12/apple-releases-watchos-26-2/">WatchOS 26.2</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/12/apple-releases-visionos-26-2/">VisionOS 26.2</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Lastly, iOS 26.2 seems to be the release that Apple is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/phone-updates-used-to-be-annoying-the-latest-ios-is-awful/">starting to suggest as an upgrade</a> for users who hadn’t already installed it by choice. Be prepared for questions and complaints from non-nerd friends and family who’ve never even heard of “Liquid Glass”.</p>

<p>Apple, on its Apple Ads site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Search is the way most people find and download apps on the App
Store, with nearly 65 percent of downloads happening directly
after a search. To help give advertisers more opportunities to
drive downloads from search results, Apple Ads will introduce
additional ads across search queries. You don’t need to change
your campaign in order to be eligible for any new positions. Your
ad will run in either the existing position — at the top of
search results — or further down in search results. If you have a
search results campaign running, your ad will be automatically
eligible for all available positions, but you can’t select or bid
for a particular one.</p>

<p>The ad format will be the same in any position, using a default
product page or custom product page, and an optional deep link.
You’ll be billed as usual based on your pricing model: cost per
tap or cost per install.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a bad feeling about this.</p>

<p>David Shepardson, reporting for Reuters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, said Thursday it signed binding agreements with three major investors to form a joint venture to operate TikTok’s U.S. app led by American and global investors in a bid to avoid a U.S. government ban, a significant step toward ending years of uncertainty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The craziest aspect of this whole saga is that TikTok has been <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/briktok">operating illegally since Trump took office</a>. Not some sort of nitpicking technicality. The whole point of the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/pafaca">PAFACA act</a> was to ban TikTok in the US until and unless they were sold to American owners. No cloud service. No app store downloads. Trump directed the Justice Department simply not to enforce the law … and the biggest companies in the world just said <em>OK, sure</em>.</p>

<p>This just isn’t normal. There are always edge cases in the enforcement of any law. Political leanings affect priorities. <a href="https://thelawdictionary.org/article/weird-laws-by-state/">Old laws</a> are often ignored. But PAFACA was a brand new law, with bipartisan support, specifically written to target TikTok, and the Trump administration <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok">decided to just ignore it</a>. This wouldn’t happen anywhere in Europe or in, say, Japan. And it wouldn’t have happened under any previous US administration, Democrat or Republican. It’s not the biggest issue or worst wrongdoing of the Trump 2.0 administration, but it’s clearest indication of their disregard for the rule of law.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Michael Bierut, “I Hate ITC Garamond”, for Design Observer back in 2004:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ITC Garamond was designed in 1975 by Tony Stan for the
International Typeface Corporation. Okay, let’s stop right there.
I’ll admit it: the single phrase “designed in 1975 by Tony Stan”
conjures up a entire world for me, a world of leisure suits,
harvest gold refrigerators, and “Fly, Robin, Fly” by Silver
Convention on the eight-track. A world where font designers were
called “Tony” instead of “Tobias” or “Zuzana.” Is that the trouble
with ITC Garamond? That it’s dated?</p>

<p>Maybe. Typefaces seem to live in the world differently than other
designed objects. Take architecture, for example. As Paul
Goldberger writes in his new book on the rebuilding of lower
Manhattan, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400060176/designobserver-20/"><em>Up From Zero</em></a>, “There are many phases to the
relationships we have with buildings, and almost invariably they
come around to acceptance.” Typefaces, on the other hand, seem to
work the other way: they are enthusiastically embraced on arrival,
and then they wear out their welcome. Yet there are fonts from the
disco era that have been successively revived by new generations.
Think of <a href="http://corporate.gettyimages.com/marketing/Taxi03Gallery/en-us/index.html">Pump</a>, <a href="http://corporate.gettyimages.com/marketing/taxi/Taxi02Gallery/en-us/index.html">Aachen</a>, or even Tony Stan’s own
<a href="https://designobserver.com/unnecessary-revival/">American Typewriter.</a> But not ITC Garamond.</p>

<p>The most distinctive element of the typeface is its enormous
lower-case x-height. In theory this improves its legibility, but
only in the same way that dog poop’s creamy consistency in theory
should make it more edible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can’t explain how it is that I’ve never linked to this piece before.</p>

<p>Katie Deighton, reporting last month for The Wall Street Journal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Henry Modisett wanted his employer to stand out. Competitors of
the artificial-intelligence firm Perplexity were embracing their
science-fiction roots with futuristic branding that felt cold to
him. So Modisett, the firm’s vice president of design, looked to
the past.</p>

<p>He plowed through graphic-design books and tomes of logos
featuring obscure examples like Hungarian oil companies from the
’80s. But he kept coming back to a slender, bookish typeface
famously used in Apple’s “Think Different” campaign. Modisett in
2023 began slipping a cousin of the font into Perplexity’s
software and marketing materials.</p>

<p>“It felt fresh,” he said.</p>

<p>Not anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s custom variant of <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/garamond-font-itc/">ITC Garamond</a> was called, appropriately enough, <a href="https://www.dafont.com/apple-garamond.font">Apple Garamond</a>. Apple adopted it in 1984 with the <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/news/unboxing-vintage-macintosh-128k">introduction of the Macintosh</a>, and continued using it through the early years of the Aqua/iMac aesthetic. For me it evokes the pinnacle of the six-color era. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography_of_Apple_Inc.">Apple’s brand identity</a> and marketing materials, after Apple Garamond <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2005/06/shuffling">came Myriad</a> — which Apple commissioned custom variants of from Adobe. And then Myriad was succeeded by San Francisco, which I suspect still has many years ahead of it. For the last 40 years Apple has only gone through three identity fonts: Garamond → Myriad → San Francisco.</p>

<p>That this style of font is back in vogue is fun. It’s a good look. Friendly. Serious but not staid. The typeface a lot of these brands are using for this today is <a href="https://github.com/Instrument/instrument-serif">Instrument Serif</a>, which I don’t love. It’s not bad. But it’s not great. Apple Garamond was great.</p>

<p>(ITC Garamond — but not condensed — served, distinctively, as both the display and body text typeface for O’Reilly books <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=programming+perl+book&amp;udm=2">in their heyday</a>. That typeface doesn’t look or feel Apple-like at all, nor does Apple Garamond look or feel O’Reilly-like at all.)</p>

<p>Gift Card Database (GCDB) has a guide to spotting tampered gift cards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whilst it may seem unusual, you should tear open this version of
Apple gift card before you purchase it so that you can inspect the
redemption code. Look for missing or scratched off characters (it
may be as subtle as changing an L to look like an I).</p>

<p>If you’re satisfied that the redemption code is legible and
undamaged, you can purchase the gift card by scanning the barcode
on the other side. If staff question your decision to open it
first, calmly explain why you were checking it and refer them to
the image above if it helps.</p>

<p>The one major downside of this precaution is that it requires you
to basically destroy the gift card packaging so if it’s intended
as a present you may just have to give them the smaller inner card
instead. Still, it’s better to be safe than sorry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not bashful, but I’d be very uncomfortable opening gift cards before I purchased them. The whole point of this is that gift card scams are on the rise. If I saw someone opening gift cards in-store before purchasing them, I’d think they were shameless scammers. If you need to destroy the retail packaging for a gift card to feel certain it hasn’t been tampered with, the whole system seems fundamentally broken. (And just eyeballing the redemption code doesn’t prove it hasn’t been tampered with.)</p>

<p>You will recall <a href="https://hey.paris/posts/appleid/">the Apple Account fiasco of Paris Buttfield-Addison</a>, whose entire iCloud account and library of iTunes and App Store media purchases were lost when his Apple Account was locked, seemingly after he attempted to redeem a tampered $500 Apple Gift Card that he purchased from a major retailer. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/13/buttfield-addison-apple-account">I wrote about it</a>, as did <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/12/13/locked-out-of-apple-account-due-to-gift-card/">Michael Tsai</a>, <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-account-lockout/">Nick Heer</a>, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/12/13/locked-out-how-a-gift-card-purchase-destroyed-an-apple-account">Malcom Owen at AppleInsider</a>, and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/15/apple_dev_bad_gift_card_code/">Brandon Vigliarolo at The Register</a>. Buttfield-Addison has updated his post a few times, including a note that Executive Relations — Apple’s top-tier support SWAT team — was looking into the matter. To no avail, at least yet, alas.</p>

<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/2025/12/17/compromised-apple-gift-card-leads-to-apple-account-lockout/">Adam Engst, writing at TidBITS today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is one way the Apple community could exert some leverage
over Apple. Since innocently redeeming a compromised Apple Gift
Card can have serious negative consequences, we should all avoid
buying Apple Gift Cards and spread the word as widely as possible
that they could essentially be malware. Sure, most Apple Gift
Cards are probably safe, but do you really want to be the person
who gives a close friend or beloved grandchild a compromised card
that locks their Apple Account? And if someone gives you one,
would you risk redeeming it? It’s digital Russian roulette.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suspect that one part of Buttfield-Addison’s fiasco is the fact that his seemingly problematic gift card was for $500, not a typical amount like $25, but that’s just a suspicion on my part. We don’t know — because key to the Kafka-esque nature of the whole nightmare is that his account cancellation was a black box. Not only has Apple not yet restored his deactivated Apple Account, at no point in the process have they explained why it was deactivated in the first place. We’re left to guess that it was related to the tampered gift card and that the relatively high value of the card in question was related. $500 is a higher value than average for an Apple gift card, but that amount is less than the average price for a single iPhone. Apple itself <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/apple-gift-card-2001-dollars.png">sets a limit of $2,000</a> on <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-giftcard/giftcard">gift cards in the US</a>, so $500 shouldn’t be considered an inherently suspicious amount. </p>

<p>The whole thing <em>does</em> make me nervous about redeeming, or giving, Apple gift cards. Scams in general seem to be getting more sophisticated. Buttfield-Addison says he bought the card directly from “a major brick-and-mortar retailer (Australians, think Woolworths scale; Americans, think Walmart scale)”. Until we get some clarity on this I feel like I’d only redeem Apple gift cards at an Apple retail store, for purchases <em>not</em> tied to my Apple Accounts. (I’ve <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/11/about-migrating-apple-account-purchases-between-accounts">still</a> got two — one for iCloud, one for media purchases.)</p>

<p>In addition to the uncertainty this leaves us with regarding the redemption of Apple gift cards, I have to wonder what the hell happens to these Apple Accounts that are deactivated for suspected fraud. You would think that once escalated high enough in Apple’s customer support system, someone at Apple could just flip a switch and re-activate the account. The fact that Buttfield-Addison’s account has not yet been restored, despite the publicity and apparent escalation to Executive Relations, makes me think it <em>can’t</em> be restored. I don’t know how that can be, but it sure seems like that’s the case. Darth Vader’s “And no disintegrations” admonition ought to be in effect for something like this. I have the sinking feeling that the best Apple is able to do is something seemingly ridiculous, like refund Buttfield-Addison for every purchase he ever made on the account and tell him to start over with a new one.</p>

<p>My other question: Were any humans involved in the decision to deactivate (disintegrate?) his account, or was it determined purely by some sort of fraud detection algorithm?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Very shortly after I posted the above, Buttfield-Addison <a href="https://hey.paris/posts/appleid/">posted an update</a> that his account was successfully restored by the ninja on Apple’s Executive Relations team assigned to his case. That’s great. But that still leaves the question of how safe Apple gift cards are to redeem on one’s Apple Account. It also leaves the question of how this happened in the first place, and why it took the better part of a week to resolve.</p>

<p>Wes Fenlon, writing for PC Gamer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did Windows 3.1 really ship with a garish color scheme that was
<em>dared</em> into being? That was a story I needed to hear, so I went
digging for the credits of the Microsoft employees who worked on
the user interface back then and found my way to <a href="https://www.virginiahowlett.com/about">Virginia
Howlett</a>, who joined Microsoft in 1985 as the company’s
first interface designer, and worked there up through the launch
of Windows 95.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Howlett:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have been mystified about why that particular theme causes so
much comment in the media. Maybe it’s partly the catchy name.
(Never underestimate the power of a good brand name!)</p>

<p>I do remember some discussion about whether we should include it,
and some snarky laughter. But it was not intended as a joke. It
was not inspired by any hot dog stands, and it was not included as
an example of a bad interface — although it was one. It was just
a garish choice, in case somebody out there liked ugly bright red
and yellow.</p>

<p>The ‘Fluorescent’ theme was also pretty ugly, but it didn’t have a
catchy name, so I’ve never heard anything about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember this color theme, because I had to use Windows 3.1 at a few jobs in the 1990s, and anyone who used it remembers “Hot Dog Stand”. Howlett’s explanation is exactly what I always thought. It wasn’t for accessibility. It wasn’t a dare or a joke. It was something they knew was ugly and they shipped it anyway in case people wanted an ugly UI.</p>

<p>That’s Microsoft.</p>

<p>The letter is typeset in Papyrus, the typeface for which James Cameron’s affection inspired not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhlJNJopOQ">one</a> but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8PdffUfoF0">two</a> classic SNL shorts starring Ryan Gosling — which <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bbcradio1/video/7179200551207357702?lang=en">Cameron has a good sense of humor about</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://aphelis.net/actual-copy-terrence-malicks-notice-projectionists-tree-life/">Terrence Malick’s letter</a> accompanying <em>Tree of Life</em> in 2011 was plainly and humbly set in Helvetica. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7gv7hb/david_lynchs_memos_to_projectionists_for/">David Lynch’s accompanying <em>Mulholland Drive</em></a> was also in Helvetica, but in a very Lynchian way. And then there is Stanley Kubrick, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/1n5spa8/stanley_kubricks_letter_to_projectionists/">whose letter to projectionists that accompanied <em>Barry Lyndon</em></a> was typeset in Futura — quite the feat in 1975. (It was almost certainly <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/148003/mid-century">IBM’s Mid-Century</a> typeface, a <a href="https://typecast.munk.org/2011/04/25/1964-nomda-blue-book-ibm-font-styles/">beautiful adaptation</a> of Futura <a href="https://archive.org/details/ibm-executive-typefaces">for their Executive line of typewriters</a>.) Cool custom letterhead on Kubrick’s as well.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tim Nudd, <a href="https://adage.com/creativity/work/aa-apple-tv-mnemonic-visual-branding/">writing at Ad Age a few weeks ago</a> (paywalled, alas):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we <a href="https://adage.com/creativity/campaigns-commercials/aa-creative-ads-today-apple-kraft-mac-cheese-lexus-philadelphia-cream-cheese/">mentioned in roundup</a> yesterday, Finneas (aka, Finneas
O’Connell) has developed a new sonic logo for Apple TV, the
streaming service previously known as Apple TV+. However, the
rebrand, created with Apple agency TBWA\Media Arts Lab, goes
beyond the audio mnemonics to include a striking new visual look
as well.</p>

<p>The visual branding centers on layers of shifting colored light, a
metaphor for the range of genres and emotions that Apple TV has
cultivated since its 2019 debut.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I held off on posting about this new Apple TV fanfare (a.k.a. <em>sonic logo</em>, a.k.a. <em>mnemonic</em> ) until I’d experienced it a few times, and after a few weeks, watching a bunch of episodes from a few Apple TV series — <em><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/mr-scorsese/umc.cmc.4a06j5lm5pxny9nx505zo5g0y">Mr. Scorsese</a></em>, a 5-star five-part documentary by Rebecca Miller, absolutely riveting; <em><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/pluribus/umc.cmc.37axgovs2yozlyh3c2cmwzlza">Pluribus</a></em>, Vince Gilligan’s excellent new the-less-you-know-about-it-before-you-start-watching-<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/21/pluribus-carol-sturka-ama">the-better</a> series starring Rhea Seehorn; and <em><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/the-morning-show/umc.cmc.25tn3v8ku4b39tr6ccgb8nl6m">The Morning Show</a></em> season 4, a series that’s skirting <em>just</em> above the good-enough-to-keep-watching line for me — I’m willing to render a verdict.</p>

<p>I love it.</p>

<p>The old one was not bad. But “not bad” should never be good enough for Apple. I can’t find anyone from Apple stating so explicitly, but it seems pretty obvious that the piano chord accompanying the old fanfare was meant to evoke the Macintosh startup chime. That’s a neat idea. And no one is more a fan of the Macintosh than me. I’d argue that the Mac remains <em>the</em> definitive Apple product, the one that best exemplifies everything the company does and should stand for. So harking back to the Macintosh was an interesting idea for the Apple TV fanfare/sonic logo/mnemonic.</p>

<p>But: it just wasn’t great. What makes that chord great for a computer booting up doesn’t make it great for a cinematic sonic logo. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV3HUDMQ-F8">Netflix’s “tudum”</a> is so iconic that it’s <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum">the name of their company blog</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08PQRA6MLo">HBO’s static + chanted om</a> is the OG standard-setter. I suspect the new Apple TV fanfare will be seen in that class. The old one was not.</p>

<p>The new one feels like a branding stroke unto itself. Sonically, it doesn’t evoke anything else. It just sounds rich and cool. Visually, with its rotating prism effect, it does evoke the classic six-color Apple logo. Thus, despite moving away from a sonic callback to the Macintosh, the overall effect feels <em>more</em> rooted to Apple’s on-the-cusp-of-a-half-century history. The change makes Apple TV original content feel more like a part of Apple, less like a possible passing fancy (which is what <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/17/belloni-cue-interview">many in Hollywood fear</a>).</p>

<p>That prism effect was created practically. From <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tbwamedia-arts-lab_at-mal-we-partnered-with-apple-tv-to-reimagine-activity-7391899271060582400-8OW9/">a LinkedIn post from Apple’s longtime agency partner TBWA Media Arts Lab</a> (no clue why they posted this on LinkedIn, of all places):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Built from real glass and captured entirely in camera, the new
identity explores reflection, color, and light to express the
cinematic spirit at the heart of Apple TV. Every shimmer was made
for real, no CG shortcuts, a nod to Apple’s belief that craft
should be felt, not faked.</p>

<p>The work spans the entire platform, from a sharp five-second show
open to a full-length cinematic version for films, paired with a
new sonic logo composed by Oscar winner Finneas and a custom
typeface, SF TV, developed with Apple’s design team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They include a very short video showing behind the scenes of its creation. It matters not to me that they photographed this practically, rather than via computer-generated graphics, but the bottom line is that it looks cool, timeless, and Apple-y.</p>

<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/music/news/finneas-discusses-apple-tv-originals-mnemonic-intro-1236568433/">Chris Willman at Variety has an interview with Finneas</a> (O’Connell) regarding the music:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Mnemonic</em>, Finneas says, “is sort of a beautiful word for a
logo” accompanied by sound. “The things that I think of as real
classic mnemonics are NBC — you can hear that in your head — or
HBO has its static.” Finneas is well aware of how modern
streaming consumption might make this especially ubiquitous,
household by household. “If you’re binge-ing the whole season of
<em>Ted Lasso</em> or <em>Severance</em> or <em>Disclaimer</em>” (the last of those
being the limited series that he composed the score for himself),
“you’re going to hear the mnemonic 10 times in one day. So it’s
gotta be something that’s like the bite of ginger between rolls
or something, you know?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See and hear for yourself. Here’s the old Apple TV mnemonic:</p>

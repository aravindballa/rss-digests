<p>Jacob Krol, writing for Techradar:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve seen a broad range of content, but I’ve been waiting for
something live — specifically, live sports. Seeing that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/exclusive-those-phones-are-being-treated-just-like-any-other-camera-inside-apples-first-friday-night-baseball-broadcast-shot-on-iphone-17-pro">Apple
TV+’s <em>Friday Night Baseball</em> is capturing games with the iPhone
17 Pro and 17 Pro Max</a> gave me some hope, and now we have a
confirmed release. In what might be the start of something new,
select Los Angeles Lakers games will be live-streamed in Apple
Immersive for the Vision Pro this coming season.</p>

<p>It’s not every game, but for those that are streaming — exclusive
to the $3,500 Spatial Computer — you’ll get access to views that
put you right in the middle of the action. Special cameras that
support the format will be set courtside and under each basket to
give you perspectives that amp up the immersion. The Lakers’ games
will be shot using a special version of Blackmagic Design’s URSA
Cine Immersive Live camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kind of weird, to me, that it wasn’t Apple’s own Friday Night Baseball broadcasts first, but I can’t wait to try this.</p>

<p>Pablo Manríquez, reporting for Migrant Insider:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has quietly removed DeICER, a civic-reporting app used to
log immigration enforcement activity, from its App Store after a
law enforcement complaint — invoking a rule normally reserved for
protecting marginalized groups from hate speech.</p>

<p>According to internal correspondence reviewed by Migrant Insider,
Apple told developer Rafael Concepcion that the app violated
Guideline 1.1.1, which prohibits “defamatory, discriminatory, or
mean-spirited content” directed at “religion, race, sexual
orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted
groups.”</p>

<p>But Apple’s justification went further. “Information provided to
Apple by law enforcement shows that your app violates Guideline
1.1.1 because its purpose is to provide location information
about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such
officers individually or as a group,” the company wrote in its
removal notice.</p>

<p>The decision effectively treats federal immigration agents as a
protected class — a novel interpretation of Apple’s hate-speech
policy that shields one of the most powerful arms of government
from public scrutiny.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Delicate flowers, these ICE agents are. And it’s a lie, anyway. There’s not one story about any of these apps being used to harm ICE agents. And even if such an attack happened, that wouldn’t imply it’s the <em>purpose</em> of these apps. The purpose of these apps is to protect people — citizens and non-citizens alike — <em>from ICE</em>.</p>

<p>Alas, <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-calls-ice-agents-a-vulnerable-group-removes-ice-spotting-app-red-dot/">there’s no more courage, conviction, or honesty from Google</a> on the Android side of the fence either.</p>

<p>It’d be both interesting and honest if either Apple or Google justified these app bannings by simply saying the Trump administration demanded them and that they — Apple and Google — fear reprisal from Trump if they don’t comply.</p>

<p>Joseph Cox, reporting for 404 Media:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple removed an app for preserving TikToks, Instagram reels, news
reports, and videos documenting abuses by ICE, 404 Media has
learned. The app, called Eyes Up, differs from other banned apps
such as ICEBlock which were designed to report sightings of ICE
officials in real-time to warn local communities. Eyes Up,
meanwhile, was more of an aggregation service pooling together
information to preserve evidence in case the material is needed in
the future in court.</p>

<p>The news shows <a href="https://www.404media.co/iceblock-owner-after-apple-removes-app-we-are-determined-to-fight-this/">that Apple</a> <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-calls-ice-agents-a-vulnerable-group-removes-ice-spotting-app-red-dot/">and Google’s</a> crackdown
on ICE-spotting apps, which started after pressure from the
Department of Justice against Apple, is broader in scope than apps
that report sightings of ICE officials. It has also impacted at
least one app that was more about creating a historical record of
ICE’s activity during its mass deportation effort.</p>

<p>“Our goal is government accountability, we aren’t even doing
real-time tracking,” the administrator of Eyes Up, who said their
name was Mark, told 404 Media. Mark asked 404 Media to only use
his first name to protect him from retaliation. “I think the
[Trump] admin is just embarrassed by how many incriminating
videos we have.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes consistency is a bad thing.</p>

<p>Benoit Berthelot and Gaspard Sebag, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc. faces an investigation in France over the use of voice
recordings made with its assistant Siri. The probe has been
referred to the Office for Combating Cybercrime, the Paris
prosecutor’s office said in a statement on Monday. An Apple
spokesperson referred to <a href="https://www.apple.com/jo/newsroom/2025/01/our-longstanding-privacy-commitment-with-siri/">a blog post</a> the company published in
January about its use of voice recordings, and declined to comment
further.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/le-parquet-de-paris-ouvre-une-enquete-sur-siri-lassistant-vocal-dapple/">Politico earlier reported</a> the investigation.</p>

<p>The investigation concerns Apple’s collection of user recordings
through Siri, the digital assistant available on most of its
devices. Apple can record and retain audio interactions through
Siri to help improve its services, a feature the company says is
opt-in. Some of that data can be retained for up to two years and
reviewed by “graders”, or subcontractors, <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/improve-siri-dictation/">according to Apple</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sending recorded Siri voice interactions to Apple <em>is</em> opt-in, and the opt-in screen is very clear and cogent. It’s not just something Apple claims.</p>

<p>Amazing stuff continues to happen in the EU.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>My feelings exactly.</p>

<p>I even like staring at screensavers sometimes. But the screensavers I like watching are Apple’s aerial (and occasionally, underwater) screensavers on Apple TV. They’re slow, peaceful, and real. Vibes is chaotic, fast, and phony.</p>

<p>MG Siegler, writing at Spyglass:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think that’s the real revelation here. It’s less about
consumption and more about <em>creation</em>. I <a href="https://500ish.com/wither-on-the-vine-d8893fddf07e?ref=spyglass.org">previously wrote</a>
about how I was an early investor in Vine in part because it felt
like it could be analogous to Instagram. Thanks in large part to
filters, that app made it easy for anyone to think they were good
enough to be a photographer. It didn’t matter if they were or not,
they <em>thought</em> they were — I was one of them — so everyone
posted their photos. Vine felt like it could have been that for
video thanks to its clever tap-to-record mechanism. But actually,
it became a network for a lot of really talented amateurs to
figure out a new format for funny videos on the internet. When
Twitter acquired the company and dropped the ball, TikTok took
that idea and scaled it (thanks to ByteDance paying um, <em>Meta</em>
billions of dollars for distribution, and their own very smart
algorithms).</p>

<p>In a way, Sora feels like enabling everyone to be a TikTok
creator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t want to predict if Sora is a fad or has staying power, but so far <a href="https://sora.chatgpt.com/p/s_68e5c38a9d28819193068a89359164f7">I enjoy it</a> in a way that I haven’t enjoyed a new social network in years. It’s just fun to dash off a stupid video with no more work than a quick text prompt, and the friends I’m following are making some damn funny clips every day.</p>

<p>The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis were awarded
the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday in Sweden for showing that
two properties of quantum mechanics, the physical laws that rule
the subatomic realm, could be observed in a system large enough to
see with the naked eye.</p>

<p>“There is no advanced technology today that does not rely on
quantum mechanics,” Olle Eriksson, chairman of the Nobel Committee
for Physics, said during the announcement of the award. The
laureates’ discoveries, he added, paved the way for technologies
like the cellphone, cameras and fiber optic cables. It also helped
lay the groundwork for current attempts to build a quantum
computer, a device that could compute and process information at
speeds that would not be possible with classical computers.</p>

<p>Can you believe these woke dopes gave this award to three people, and not one of them is Donald Trump?</p>

‘Slide to stop’ gesture</a>. Both alarms and timers were
updated in iOS 26 to utilize a new design with much larger

replaced the ‘Stop’ button with a new sliding gesture that
requires a little more intentionality. This should make accidental

<p>Riley Testut, co-founder of AltStore:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By far our number one request, we’re planning to launch AltStore
PAL in more countries <em>later this year</em> in response to various
regulatory changes around the world. Specifically, we plan to
launch in Japan, Brazil, and Australia before the end of the year,
with the UK to follow in 2026. This is great news for the fight to
open app distribution, as it will give consumers more options to
install apps they otherwise couldn’t from the App Store — such as
my <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/altstores-clip-is-the-best-clipboard-manager-on-ios-yet/">clipboard manager Clip</a>.</p>

<p>While we wait to hear more from Apple on exact timing, if you’re a
developer interested in distributing your app through AltStore PAL
in one of these countries feel free to <a href="https://faq.altstore.io/developers/distribute-with-altstore-pal">check out our
documentation</a> now to get a head start. Overall though, we
couldn’t be more excited to make AltStore PAL available to
millions of more people; we truly believe it’s a matter of time
before alternative app marketplaces are available worldwide, and
each new country brings us one step closer to that goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s cowardly abandonment of ICEBlock in the face of the first whiff of pressure from the Trump administration is perhaps the best evidence yet that Apple’s arguments in favor of their App Store being the single source for third-party software do not hold water. I’m not going to argue that ICEBlock is an essential app, or super duper popular, but it is a very serious app that aims to address a very serious situation. In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/iceblock.app/post/3m2alyaghbk2n">Apple’s email to developer Joshua Aaron informing him of their decision</a> to pull ICEBlock from the App Store, they justified the decision on the spurious basis that the app contained “objectionable content”. The only content ICEBlock contains is the location of law enforcement activity. Waze — and more notably, Apple’s own Maps app — do the exact same thing for highway speed traps.</p>

<p>Apple’s decision shows that developers cannot trust the App Store to distribute apps that anyone in the Trump administration might “object to”. ICEBlock is an iOS exclusive app and service for serious privacy reasons that are grounded in technical merit. But, exactly as many critics of the App-Store-as-exclusive-distribution-point-for-native-software model have long warned, it’s proven to be a choke point that Apple was unwilling to defend. Apple frequently invokes the word <em>trust</em> as a reason for the App Store model. But their treatment of ICEBlock indicates they are untrustworthy when it comes to showing any sort of backbone regarding Trump’s mad-king slide into authoritarianism, and thus, so too is the entire iOS platform in jurisdictions like the US, where the App Store remains the exclusive distribution source. What good is building the most privacy-focused, user-friendly platform in the world when Apple will disallow an app for which airtight privacy is essential? What happens when Trump lickspittles go after women’s healthcare apps like Planned Parenthood?</p>

<p>If there were a way to distribute apps outside the App Store in the US (TestFlight doesn’t count, as it has hard limits on how many users can get the app — and it’s not clear that Apple hasn’t blocked ICEBlock from TestFlight too), US iPhone users would still have access to ICEBlock. If that <em>were</em> the case, perhaps the Trump administration would then “demand” that Apple revoke Aaron’s developer account. But if that happened, at least we’d know just how pants-wettingly terrified Apple is of the president, in our purported liberal democracy.</p>

<p>There’s lots of other interesting news in Testut’s AltStore status report, including the news that they’re adding Fediverse support to AltStore to distribute app updates and news (and more); converting to a public benefit corporation; have raised $6 million in funding; and are donating $500,000 of that money to help fund indie iOS Fediverse apps like Tapbots’s <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a> (Mastodon) and <a href="https://tapbots.com/phoenix/">Phoenix</a> (Bluesky) clients and The Iconfactory’s <a href="https://usetapestry.com/">Tapestry</a> feed aggregator.</p>

<p>Wiley Hodges, a 22-year veteran of Apple product marketing, who retired in 2022, in an open letter he sent to Tim Cook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t know where this leaves me as an Apple customer, but I do
know that it upsets me as an Apple shareholder. I am asking you
and your team to more clearly explain the basis on which you made
the decision to remove ICEBlock — and how the government showed
good faith and strong evidence in making its demand of Apple, or
that you reinstate the app in the App Store.</p>

<p>I hope that as a man of integrity and principle you can understand
how outrageous this situation is. Even more, I hope you recognize
how every inch you voluntarily give to an authoritarian regime
adds to their illegitimately derived power. We are at a critical
juncture in our country’s history where we face the imminent
threat of the loss of our constitutional republic. It is up to all
of us to demand that the rule of law rather than the whims of a
handful of people — even elected ones — govern our collective
enterprise. Apple and you are better than this. You represent the
best of what America can be, and I pray that you will find it in
your heart to continue to demonstrate that you are true to the
values you have so long and so admirably espoused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you give a bully your lunch money, they always come back for more. </p>

<p>Disney learned this. Last December, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/16/nx-s1-5230274/abc-settles-with-trump-for-15-million-now-he-wants-to-sue-other-news-outlets">Disney settled a lawsuit Trump had filed against ABC News and host George Stephanopoulos for $15 million</a>. The lawsuit was bullshit; nearly all experts agreed that if Disney/ABC had taken the case to court, <a href="https://fair.org/home/abc-settles-with-trump-in-a-case-it-could-have-won/">they’d have won</a>. Disney settled — with both the $15 million and “a note of regret” — thinking, surely, that this would get Trump off their back. Put them on Trump’s good side. Then came <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/09/23/goddard-kimmel">the Jimmy Kimmel fiasco</a>, when they <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/09/24/kimmel-returns">finally stood up</a> and said, effectively, “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/03/fuck-you-make-me">Fuck you, make me</a>.”</p>

<p>Hodges, earlier in his letter, makes reference to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Adaringfireball.net+san+bernardino+fbi&amp;ia=web">Apple’s 2016 standoff with the FBI over a locked iPhone belonging to the mass shooter in San Bernardino</a>, California. The FBI and Justice Department pressured Apple to create a version of iOS that would allow them to backdoor the iPhone’s passcode lock. Apple adamantly refused.</p>

<p>The message Trump and his lickspittles surely took from Apple acceding to their “demand” regarding ICEBlock — a demand made without an iota of legal justification, nor any factual justification that the app was being used to put ICE law enforcements agents in harm’s way — is that when they make a demand to Apple, Apple will respond not with the four words “Fuck you, make me” (as they did in the 2016 San Bernardino case), but instead “Whatever you say goes”. It was, obviously, easier for Apple to stand on principle in 2016, when Barack Obama, a man who deeply respected the Constitution and the principle of rule of law, was president. But it’s more important to stand on those same principles with Trump — a would-be mad king with no respect nor even understanding of the Constitution or rule of law — in office.</p>

<p>If not now, when? Apple will, I believe, find out.</p>

<p>MacKenzie Sigalos, CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenAI and Advanced Micro Devices have reached a deal that could
see Sam Altman’s company take a 10% stake in the chipmaker. AMD
stock skyrocketed more than 30% on Monday following the news.</p>

<p>OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD’s Instinct graphics
processing units over multiple years and across multiple
generations of hardware, the companies said Monday. It will kick
off with an initial 1-gigawatt rollout of chips in the second half
of 2026.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It only happens once a decade or so, but the most exciting times in tech occur when there’s a breakthrough that’s severely hardware constrained. That includes hardware like infrastructure — bandwidth was a massive constraint during the dot-com boom. It wasn’t even feasible to download <em>audio</em>, like podcasts, for the first decade of the consumer internet boom, let alone video. But it was inevitable that we’d get there.</p>

<p>Right now we’re <em>severely</em> constrained on compute for AI. In a few years, we’ll look back on today’s state of affairs the way we look back on dial-up modems.</p>

<p>Andrew Liszewski, The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lumafield has <a href="https://www.lumafield.com/battery-report#battery-quality-report">released the results of a new study</a> of
lithium-ion batteries that “reveals an enormous gap in quality
between brand-name batteries and low-cost cells” that are readily
available through online stores including Amazon and Temu. The
company used <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/18/23640484/lumafield-neptune-ct-scanner-3d-x-ray-hands-on-interview">its computed tomography (CT) scanners</a>, capable
of peering inside objects in 3D using X-rays, to analyze over
1,000 lithium-ion batteries. It found dangerous manufacturing
defects in low-cost and counterfeit batteries that could
potentially lead to fires and explosions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My gut feeling has long been that cheap battery packs and cheap products with integrated batteries (like all the junk Temu sells) are dangerous. This analysis basically proves it. (I’d have linked directly to Lumafield’s report, but it’s only available by submitting your name and email address, so Liszewski’s summary at The Verge is a better quick read.)</p>

	<summary type="text">It’s rather chilling to consider what Apple would have done if the Trump administration had “demanded” a list of device IDs and user identities for everyone who had installed ICEBlock. Or what Apple *will* do if such a demand pops into one of their dimwitted but cruel minds.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/apple-takes-down-ice-tracking-app-after-pressure-from-ag-bondi">Ashley Oliver, reporting for Fox Business</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DOJ officials, at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi,
asked Apple to take down ICEBlock, a move that comes as Trump
administration officials have claimed the tool, which allows users
to anonymously report ICE agents’ presence, puts agents in danger
and helps shield illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>“We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock
app from their App Store — and Apple did so,” Bondi said in a
statement to Fox News Digital.</p>

<p>“ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing
their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable
red line that cannot be crossed,” Bondi added. “This Department of
Justice will continue making every effort to protect our brave
federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day
to keep Americans safe.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fox, in its opening paragraph, describes Bondi as having “asked” Apple to remove ICEBlock from the App Store, but Bondi’s own statement uses the verb “demand”. The difference is not nitpicking. No one, not even Bondi, is claiming any aspect of ICEBlock is illegal. Thus it’s not merely inappropriate but outrageous — and yet another among dozens of other causes for alarm regarding Trump 2.0’s decidedly authoritarian turn — for the DOJ to “demand” that Apple do anything about it. But demand they did, and comply did Apple. (Check those lips <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder">for Cheetos dust</a> before heading home today.)</p>

<p>Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert, Peter Kafka, and Kwan Wei Kevin Tan, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iceblock-app-store-removed-2025-10">reporting for Business Insider</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has removed ICEBlock, an app that allowed users to monitor
and report the location of immigration enforcement officers, from
the App Store.</p>

<p>“We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to
discover apps,” Apple said in a statement to Business Insider.
“Based on information we’ve received from law enforcement about
the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and
similar apps from the App Store.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ICEBlock developer Joshua Aaron, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/iceblock.app/post/3m2alyaghbk2n">posting on the ICEBlock Bluesky account</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We just received a message from Apple’s App Review that #ICEBlock
has been removed from the App Store due to “objectionable
content”. The only thing we can imagine is this is due to pressure
from the Trump Admin.</p>

<p>We have responded and we’ll fight this! #resist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is clearly nothing illegal about ICEBlock.<sup id="fnr1-2025-10-03"><a href="#fn1-2025-10-03">1</a></sup> It’s just information, obviously protected by the First Amendment. Law enforcement officers in the United States have no right to avoid being recorded nor their actions being reported and shared. Reporting and publishing where police are policing is free speech and fundamental to the civil rights and liberties of a free society.</p>

<p>We can all wish Apple had fought this “demand”. I certainly do. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohPToBog_-g">John Oliver’s “Fuck you, make me”</a> argument <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/03/fuck-you-make-me">sprung to mind</a> for me this morning. But that’s wishful thinking. I believe there are many lines Apple would not cross, even if it means taking on the ire of Trump administration lickspittles, if not the barely literate wrath of the mad king himself on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/truth_social_is_just_trumps_blog">his sad little blog</a>. Apple may well eventually — if not soon — be forced to define those lines. But keeping ICEBlock in the App Store isn’t one of them. You might believe it should be. There’s a big part of me that believes it should be. But I can also <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">see why it’s not</a>. Pick your battles.</p>

<p>I wrote about ICEBlock twice back in late July. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/07/iceblock">Quoting extensively from my initial post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ICEBlock app is interesting in and of itself (and from my
tire-kicking test drive, appears to be a well-crafted and designed
app), as will be Apple’s response if (when?) the Trump
administration takes offense to the app’s existence. Back in 2019,
kowtowing to tacit demands from China, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/10/apple-pulls-hkmaps">Apple removed from the App
Store an app called HKmap.live</a> which helped pro-democracy
activists in Hong Kong know the location of police and protest
activity. The app broke no Hong Kong laws, but <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/10/768841864/after-china-objects-apple-removes-app-used-by-hong-kong-protesters">scared the
thin-skinned skittish lickspittles in the Chinese Communist
Party</a>. (Remember too that in 2019, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/07/taiwan-flag-emoji">Apple removed the Taiwan
flag emoji</a> (🇹🇼) from the iOS 13 keyboard for users in Hong
Kong and Macau.)</p>

<p>One defense from Apple regarding HKmap.live, however, was that the
iOS app was a thin wrapper around the website, which website
remained fully functional and could be saved to an iPhone user’s
home screen. Removing the app from the App Store thus did not
prevent Hongkongers from accessing it. (<a href="https://hkmap.live/">That website</a> today
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKmap.live">seems to be defunct</a>.)</p>

<p>ICEBlock is different. It is <em>only</em> available as a native iOS app.
According to the developers, this is for technical reasons. From
their web page explaining <a href="https://www.iceblock.app/android">why they <em>can’t</em> offer an Android
version</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At ICEBlock, user privacy and security are paramount. Our
application is designed to provide as much anonymity as possible
without storing any user data or creating accounts. While we
understand the desire for an Android version of ICEBlock,
achieving this level of anonymity on Android is not feasible due
to the inherent requirements of push notification services.</p>

<p>To send push notifications on Android, it is necessary to use a
mechanism that requires storing device IDs. This means that we
would need to maintain a privately hosted database to store these
identifiers. Storing such data, even if it’s anonymized,
introduces significant privacy risks. [...]</p>

<p>In contrast, iOS offers us the flexibility to deliver push
notifications while adhering strictly to our design philosophy.
Apple’s ecosystem allows for push notifications to be sent
without requiring us to store any user-identifiable information.
This ensures that ICEBlock remains completely anonymous and
secure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To deliver push notifications on Android, the developers claim
they would need to maintain a database of device IDs, create a
user account system to manage those device IDs, and all of that
server-stored data would be susceptible to law enforcement
subpoenas and pro-ICE red hat hackers. (What “brown shirts” were
to the Nazis, we should make “red hats” to MAGA.)</p>

<p>To maintain anonymity and store zero user data, there is and can
be no web app version of ICEBlock. There is and can be no Android
version. Only iOS supports the security and privacy features for
ICEBlock to offer what it does, the way it does. Here’s to hoping
that Apple will proudly defend it if push comes to shove.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s removal of ICEBlock from the App Store is, in multiple ways, <em>worse</em> than Apple’s removal of HKmap.live from the App Store back in 2019. First, you cannot take a disagreement with the Chinese government to court. Here in the United States, you can. But Apple chose not to. That’s a display of weakness. </p>

<p>Second, from the perspective of users, without the HKmap.live “app”, Hong Kong iPhone users could still access all the functionality via the website, and the website could be saved to their home screens as a web app that was, I believe, functionally identical to the version from the App Store. I put “app” in quotes above because the HKmap.live app was really just a thin wrapper around the service’s mobile website. Hongkongers lost some convenience, and they lost the ability to tell non-technical protestor friends “just get it from the App Store”, but it’s not <em>that</em> much more complex to explain how to add a website to your iPhone home screen as a web app.</p>

<p>With ICEBlock, the entire thing is simply no longer available. If you already have ICEBlock installed, the installed version still functions on your iPhone, but, until and if Apple changes its mind, there will be no further software updates and new users are unable to download it. Nor will current users be able to re-download the app on a new iPhone — and now is “new iPhone” season. And, seemingly, there can be no web app (or Android) version of ICEBlock that offers the same level of anonymity as the native iOS version — with notifications, but without user accounts nor any database of device IDs for notifications that would be subject to subpoena from ICEBlock.</p>

<p>The gist of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/26/iceblock-trust-apple">my second post on ICEBlock</a> from back in July is that ICEBlock’s privacy-protecting architecture isn’t magic. It’s based on trust in Apple itself. Joshua Aaron doesn’t have access to ICEBlock users’ device IDs (let alone their personal identities), but ICEBlock can send push notifications to devices because Apple itself does know device IDs and users’ identities.</p>

<p>It’s rather chilling to consider what Apple would have done if the Trump administration had “demanded” a list of device IDs and user identities for everyone who had installed ICEBlock. Or what Apple <em>will</em> do if such a demand pops into one of their dimwitted but cruel minds.<sup id="fnr2-2025-10-03"><a href="#fn2-2025-10-03">2</a></sup> I suspect that’s one of the lines Apple would not cross. That Apple would stand its ground there and say “Fuck you, make us” and take it to court. But there’s only one way to find out.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<ol>

<li id="fn1-2025-10-03">
<p>It’s interesting to consider how Aaron might “fight this”. I don’t think suing the Department of Justice is an option. All Pam Bondi did was issue a “demand” to Apple. That’s inappropriate and an embarrassment, and in any normal administration would be just cause for her immediate dismissal from the job. But it’s not against the law. She didn’t issue an unconstitutional legal demand to Apple. She just issued a verbal request with an implicit threat of turning the nation’s MAGA derps and Fox News junkies against Apple. What Apple was afraid of wasn’t fighting this demand in a court of law, but in the court of public opinion.</p>

<p>So maybe Aaron sues Apple? I’m not sure he has grounds for that either, but it’d be interesting to see Apple’s lawyers argue in court that the App Store is no place for apps that protect users’ civil liberties and personal privacy.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-10-03"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn2-2025-10-03">
<p>A few people have already asked me why it took the Trump administration several months to put ICEBlock in its crosshairs and issue a takedown “demand” to Apple. <a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/iceblock-new-iphone-app-lets-users-know-when-ice-agents-are-area/16902392/">Aaron shipped the first release of ICEBlock back in April</a>, and it achieved a significant amount of well-deserved publicity in July after Trump’s ICE goons began large-scale deportation raids in Los Angeles. My answer is simple: it took them months to issue this demand because they’re so goddamn stupid and incompetent. We should be thankful for that. In a competent regime attempting an authoritarian takeover of a liberal democracy, it would have been taken down in days, not months.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2025-10-03"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<p>John Oliver on Last Week Tonight, uh, last week, regarding Disney’s initial (but brief) caving to Trump’s demands that they suspend or even fire Jimmy Kimmel for his having the temerity to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/09/23/kimmel-joke">mock the mad king for being a sociopathic ghoul</a> sliding into the depths of dementia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look, at some point you’re going to have to draw a line. So I’d
argue, why not draw it right here? And when they come to you with
stupid, ridiculous demands, picking fights that you know you could
win in court, instead of rolling over, why not stand up and use
four key words they don’t tend to teach you in business school?
Not, “OK, you’re the boss.” Not, “Whatever you say goes.” But
instead, the only phrase that can genuinely make a weak bully go
away. And that is, “Fuck you. Make me.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Fuck you, make me” is, to me, the founding principle of this nation. That was our message to King George III, a tyrant descending into madness (who even <a href="https://www.hrp.org.uk/blog/the-kings-malady-george-iiis-mental-illness-explored/">suffered from swollen legs and feet</a>, which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-swelling-legs-chronic-venous-insufficiency-health-40beb3c818cfb914645db9d1f143fdd8">rings yet another bell</a> with our current wannabe mad king). And it needs to be our response to Trump.</p>

<p>Jason Foster, reporting for MLB.com:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nine-inning games during the 2025 season have, on average, clocked
in at 2 hours, 38 minutes through Thursday, marking the third
straight season in which the average game time was 2:40 or
shorter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regular Season nine-inning @MLB games of three hours and thirty
minutes (3:30) or longer:</p>

<ul>
<li>2021: 391</li>
<li>2022: 232</li>
<li>2023: 9</li>
<li>2024: 7</li>
<li>2025: 3 (through 9/25)</li>
</ul>

<p>— MLB Communications (@MLB_PR) <a href="https://twitter.com/MLB_PR/status/1971593229293568259">September 26, 2025</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The trend marks the first time since 1983-85 that the average
nine-inning game time was 2:40 or shorter in three consecutive
seasons. The average nine-inning game time was 2:36 last season
and 2:40 in 2023.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree with many of MLB’s recent rules changes (e.g. the 10th-inning “Manfred Man” ghost runners), but the pitch clock and limit on mound visits have been unambiguous changes for the better. They don’t make the game feel hurried at all, but prior to the pitch clock, the game often felt ponderous.</p>

<p>Adobe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, Adobe announced that the company is bringing its industry
leading Adobe Premiere video editor to mobile in a powerful <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-premiere-video-editor">new
iPhone app</a> that empowers creators to make pro-quality video
on the go. The <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/app.html">Adobe Premiere mobile app</a> makes it fast,
free and intuitive for creators to edit their videos with
precision editing on a lightning-fast multi-track timeline,
produce studio-quality audio with crystal clear voiceovers and
perfectly timed AI sound effects, generate unique content and
access millions of free multimedia assets, and send work directly
to <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html">Premiere desktop</a> for fine tuning further on a larger
screen. The new mobile app offers all the video editing essentials
for free, with upgrades available for additional generative
credits and storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a little thing, but from Adobe’s press release, you’d think this new mobile version of Premiere is only available for iOS, but, as you’d hope, it’s in fact a universal app that properly supports iPadOS too. The word “iPad” doesn’t appear in Adobe’s press release.</p>

<p>Anna Gross and Tim Bradshaw, reporting for the Financial Times (updated link to a syndicated version at Ars Technica, outside the FT’s parsimonious paywall):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UK government has ordered Apple to allow access to encrypted
cloud backups of British users, after a previous attempt to issue
a broader demand that included US customers drew a furious
backlash from the Trump administration.</p>

<p>The UK Home Office demanded in early September that Apple create a
backdoor into users’ cloud storage service, but stipulated that
the order applied only to British citizens’ data, according to
people briefed on the matter. [...]</p>

<p>In February, Apple withdrew its most secure cloud storage service,
iCloud Advanced Data Protection, from the UK.</p>

<p>“Apple is still unable to offer Advanced Data Protection in the
United Kingdom to new users,” Apple said on Wednesday. “We are
gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP are not
available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of
data breaches and other threats to customer privacy.” It added:
“As we have said many times before, we have never built a back
door or master key to any of our products or services and we
never will.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is, as I understand it, a demand from the UK government to allow warrantless access to all UK citizens’ iCloud backups. And your iCloud backups, once decrypted, contain just about everything on your device. With Apple unable to offer Advanced Data Protection in the UK, if Apple complies, there’s no way around it. And, to make it even worse, the perversity of the UK Investigatory Powers Act is such that it’s a crime for Apple to even say they’ve been issued such a demand, to warn their UK users about it. Just brutal. The UK government could not be more wrong about this stance.</p>

<p>Hayden Field, The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenAI has a new version of the Sora AI video generator that it
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317092/openai-sora-text-to-video-ai-launch">launched at the end of last year</a>, and it’s arriving today
alongside <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sora-by-openai/id6744034028">a new social video app, also called Sora, for
iPhones</a>. The currently invite-only app resembles TikTok with
a feed of videos you can shuffle through. But instead of
encouraging people to stitch together duets, it asks you to record
short videos that anyone can spin into new AI-generated deepfakes — with your consent.</p>

<p>In a briefing with reporters on Monday, employees called it the
potential “ChatGPT moment for video generation.” The Sora app is
currently only available to US and Canada users, with other
countries set to follow, and when someone receives access, they
also get four additional invites to share with friends. There’s no
word on when an Android version might be released.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sora, though invitation-only at the moment, is currently #3 in the U.S. App Store. Meta’s Meta AI app, which contains, in a tab, their Vibes AI-generated video feed, is #97.</p>

<p>Also, I’m sure Sora will eventually come to Android. But, to play with it now, you need an iPhone. So tell me again how Apple is behind on AI? If you have an Android phone, you’re behind on everything except what Google itself offers (which, admittedly, is some great stuff). If you have an iPhone, you’re ahead on everything except what’s baked into iOS. Including the fact that the #1 app on the App Store today is ... Google Gemini.</p>

<p>Jason Snell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Apple, four iPhone 17 Pros will be positioned at
Fenway Park — in the Green Monster, the home dugout, and roaming
the stands. In contrast to the secrecy of last week, the
Tigers-Red Sox game will feature a bug in the corner of the screen
that shows off the shots that are coming from an iPhone.</p>

<p>Is it a self-promotional gimmick? Sure, but Apple is paying a lot
of money for MLB rights. Also, it’s not as if the company hasn’t
pushed its MLB telecasts in a bunch of different ways. The Friday
Night Baseball broadcasts look great, and have featured loads of
helmet and body cams, a cinematic depth-of-field camera, and even
in-stadium drone shots. Apple has probably earned at least one
night of iPhone Pro product integration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I skipped through the archive of the game and the footage from the iPhones was indistinguishable from the regular cameras. If not for the (subtle!) “Shot on iPhone” bug in the top right corner, I’d never have even suspected they were shot on anything other than the regular cameras Apple has been using for these broadcasts.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago designer James Barnard <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@barnardco/video/7543872443081919766">made this TikTok video</a> about what seemed to be a few mistakes in HBO’s logo. He got a bunch of crap from commenters arguing that they weren’t mistakes at all. Then he heard from the designer of the original version of the logo, from the 1970s.</p>

	<summary type="text">How in the world would that increase competition? iOS’s unique and exclusive features — which, yes, in many cases, are exclusive to the Apple device ecosystem — *are competition*.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Apple, “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/the-digital-markets-acts-impacts-on-eu-users/">The Digital Markets Act’s Impacts on EU Users</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The DMA requires Apple to make certain features work on non-Apple
products and apps before we can share them with our users.
Unfortunately, that requires a lot of engineering work, and it’s
caused us to delay some new features in the EU:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Live Translation</em> with AirPods uses Apple Intelligence to let
Apple users communicate across languages. Bringing a
sophisticated feature like this to other devices creates
challenges that take time to solve. For example, we designed
Live Translation so that our users’ conversations stay private — they’re processed on device and are never accessible to Apple — and our teams are doing additional engineering work to make
sure they won’t be exposed to other companies or developers
either.</p></li>
<li><p><em>iPhone Mirroring</em> lets our users see and interact with their
iPhone from their Mac, so they can seamlessly check their
notifications, or drag and drop photos between devices. Our
teams still have not found a secure way to bring this feature to
non-Apple devices without putting all the data on a user’s
iPhone at risk. And as a result, we have not been able to bring
the feature to the EU. [...]</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve suggested changes to these features that would protect our
users’ data, but so far, the European Commission has rejected our
proposals. And according to the European Commission, under the
DMA, it’s illegal for us to share these features with Apple users
until we bring them to other companies’ products. If we shared
them any sooner, we’d be fined and potentially forced to stop
shipping our products in the EU.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Live Translation with AirPods and iPhone Mirroring are both <em>amazing</em> features. And EU users are missing out on them. I think Apple structured this piece exactly right, by emphasizing first that the most direct effect of the DMA is that EU users are getting great features late — or never. And that list of features is only going to grow over time.</p>

<p>Under the section “Is the DMA Achieving Its Goals?”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regulators claimed the DMA would promote competition and give
European consumers more choices. But the law is not living up to
those promises. In fact, it’s having some of the opposite effects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Fewer choices</em>: When features are delayed or unavailable, EU
users don’t get the same options as users in the rest of the
world. They lose the choice to use Apple’s latest technologies,
and their devices fall further behind.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Less differentiation</em>: By forcing Apple to build features and
technologies for non-Apple products, the DMA is making the
options available to European consumers more similar. For
instance, the changes to app marketplaces are making iOS look
more like Android — and that reduces choice.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Unfair competition</em>: The DMA’s rules only apply to Apple, even
though Samsung is the smartphone market leader in Europe, and
Chinese companies are growing fast. Apple has led the way in
building a unique, innovative ecosystem that others have copied — to the benefit of users everywhere. But instead of rewarding
that innovation, the DMA singles Apple out while leaving our
competitors free to continue as they always have.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This is all true. But I have a better way to put this. If Apple were to just switch the iPhone’s OS from iOS to Android, these DMA conflicts would all go away. Apple’s not going to do that, of course, but to me it’s a crystallizing way of looking at it. The DMA is supposedly intended to increase “competition”, which in turn should increase consumer choice. But the easiest way for Apple to comply with the DMA would be to switch EU iPhones to Android — which, by a significant margin, already has majority mobile OS market share in the EU. <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/europe/">Here’s a link to StatCounter’s mobile OS stats for Europe</a> (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/eu_share_of_apples_revenue">which is not the same as the EU</a>, but as good a proxy as I could find). It’s two-thirds Android, one-third iOS — a 2-1 ratio.</p>

<p>If Apple just shipped all EU iPhones with Android instead of iOS, all of their DMA problems would be off the table. EU iPhone users would lose <em>all</em> iOS exclusive features and Apple device <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/">Continuity</a> integrations. EU consumers would effectively have no choice at all in mobile OSes. They’d just get to choose which brand of Android phone to buy.</p>

<p>How in the world would that increase competition? iOS’s unique and exclusive features — which, yes, in many cases, are exclusive to the Apple device ecosystem — <em>are competition</em>.</p>

<p>The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that would
help clear the way for a coalition of investors to run an American
version of TikTok, one that is separate from its Chinese owner,
ByteDance, so that it can keep operating in the United States.</p>

<p>The administration has been working for months to find non-Chinese
investors for a U.S. TikTok company, which Vice President JD Vance
said would be valued at $14 billion. [...]</p>

<p>The White House hasn’t said exactly who would own the U.S. version
of TikTok, but the list of potential investors includes several
powerful allies of Mr. Trump. The software giant Oracle, whose
co-founder is the billionaire Larry Ellison, will take a stake in
U.S. TikTok. Mr. Trump has also said that the media mogul Rupert
Murdoch is involved. A person familiar with the talks said the
Murdoch investments would come through Fox Corporation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>$14 billion is a ridiculous valuation. The whole thing is ridiculous, of course, but a fair valuation on the open market would surely be at least 10× that value. They’re not even pretending this is on the up-and-up. And it doesn’t answer the core problem at the heart of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/tiktok">the PAFACA Act</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute who is
focused on U.S.-China relations, said the White House’s executive
order would stoke those questions only because it says “the
divestiture includes intense monitoring of software updates,
algorithms and data flows.”</p>

<p>“If you control it, why would you need intense monitoring to know
what’s happening with it?” Mr. Sobolik said. “Monitoring the
algorithm is not the same as controlling it. That’s the head fake the
administration appears to be trying to pull here.”</p>

<p>Ryan Gould and Liana Baker, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Intel Corp. has approached Apple Inc. about securing an investment
in the ailing chipmaker, according to people familiar with the
matter, part of efforts to bolster a business that’s now partially
owned by the US government.</p>

<p>Apple and Intel also have discussed how to work more closely
together, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the deliberations are private. The talks have been early-stage and
may not lead to an agreement, the people said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Juicy notion, for sure, but I really don’t see what Intel could offer Apple. There’s <em>zero</em> chance Apple is going to go back to x86 CPUs. Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/apple-to-acquire-the-majority-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business/">already bought Intel’s cellular modem business six years ago</a> (and has used that purchase to produce the excellent C1 and C1X modems now used in the iPhone 16e and iPhone Air, respectively). Intel can’t come close to TSMC for fabricating Apple’s own chip designs.</p>

<p>So what’s left? <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/08/07/stickers">Palm-rest stickers for laptops</a>?</p>

<p>John Koblin, reporting for The New York Times (gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jimmy Kimmel’s broadcast return scored big in the ratings.</p>

<p>Tuesday’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” averaged 6.2 million
viewers, according to preliminary figures from Nielsen. That is
nearly four times bigger than his usual audience, even though more
than 20 percent of ABC affiliates boycotted the show.</p>

<p>The preliminary Nielsen figures are expected to grow in the coming
days as more data comes in. It does not include streaming
viewership.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1tjh_ZO_tY">Kimmel’s monologue last night</a> was a masterpiece. Watch it, I implore you.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, jackass, <a href="https://people.com/trump-says-jimmy-kimmel-fired-for-lack-of-talent-11812506">a week ago</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jimmy Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings more than anything else [...]”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Donald Trump, today, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115256938634035559">on his blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The
White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something
happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and
his “talent” was never there. Why would they want someone back who
does so poorly, who’s not funny, and who puts the Network in
jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE. He is yet
another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that
would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we’re
going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I
went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds
even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot
in his bad Ratings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn’t sound like a mob boss at all. And remember, the Republicans were the party that spent all of last year’s election cycle proclaiming to be the party of “free speech”, and opposed to “cancel culture”. Just sheer projection.</p>

<p>The way to deal with bullies is to stand up to them. Give them your lunch money once, they’ll keep coming back for more.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Taegan Goddard, a few days ago at Political Wire:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sudden <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2025/09/17/abc-pulls-jimmy-kimmel/">suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s show</a> after threats
from FCC chair Brendan Carr was a jolt. It looked like the next
step in Donald Trump’s campaign to silence dissent.</p>

<p>But there’s another way to see it: an opportunity.</p>

<p>It’s been clear since the last election that conservatives
dominate the independent media space. Trump rode the reach of
right-wing podcasts to victory while Kamala Harris stuck to
traditional television.</p>

<p>But those old outlets are collapsing — and they’re never
coming back.</p>

<p>That means the stars of late-night TV — Kimmel, Colbert and
others — could thrive outside corporate networks. They can build
their own platforms, reach bigger audiences, and escape the grip
of billionaires and timid executives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Goddard didn’t say it in this piece, the subtext should be that building the alternative on Substack or social media is not the answer, either. The Internet is decentralized and built exactly to counter these forces our country is facing under Trump 2.0.</p>

<p>The big problem is YouTube. With YouTube, Google has a centralized chokehold on video. We need a way that’s as easy and scalable to host video content, independently, as it is for written content. I don’t know what the answer to that is, technically, but we ought to start working on it with urgency.</p>

<p>ABC is putting Kimmel’s show back on tonight, which is great. But I think it’s essential to watch the joke that triggered his suspension. I’m linking here to a CNN post with the full clip. CNN headlined their post “What Kimmel Said About Charlie Kirk That Yanked His Show Off Air”, and that’s basically how most news outlets have phrased it.</p>

<p>But the joke wasn’t about Charlie Kirk. It wasn’t about Charlie Kirk’s assassin. It was about Donald Trump being a sociopathic ghoul. Trump was asked how he’s holding up after the death of “his friend Charlie Kirk”. You really have to watch it — a transcript of Trump’s answer does no justice to how sociopathic it was. And Kimmel called him out on it with mockery.</p>

<p>Variety:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This is misery,” Letterman said when asked about Kimmel’s
suspension, speaking at <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/theatlanticfestival/">The Atlantic Festival
2025</a> Thursday
in New York. “I feel bad about this,” he continued. “We see where
this is all going, correct? It’s managed media. And it’s no good.
It’s silly. It’s ridiculous. And you can’t go around firing
somebody because you’re fearful or trying to suck up to an
authoritarian criminal administration in the Oval Office. That’s
just not how this works.”</p>

<p>“In the world of somebody who is an authoritarian, maybe a
dictatorship, sooner or later, everyone is going to be touched,”
said Letterman.</p>

<p>Letterman also said, “The institution of the president of the
United States ought to be bigger than a guy doing a talk show.”
Kimmel’s removal from late-night TV, he said, “was predicted by
our president right after Stephen Colbert got walked off, so
you’re telling me this isn’t premeditated at some level?” [...]</p>

<p>On Wednesday, ABC suspended Kimmel’s late-night show
“indefinitely.” That came after FCC chairman Brendan Carr just
hours earlier threatened ABC and its affiliates if they didn’t
“take action” on Kimmel over what he perceived as objectionable
comments about Charlie Kirk’s killer. “We can do this the easy way
or the hard way,” Carr said on a conservative podcast. [...]</p>

<p>Regarding Carr’s comment that “we can do this the easy way or the
hard way,” Letterman said, “Who is hiring these goons — Mario
Puzo?”, referring to the author of <em>The Godfather</em>. Letterman said
when he was on TV, he never got pressure from a presidential
administration, the FCC or any other government agency about his
on-air commentary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Goons” is exactly the right word. Letterman’s commentary on this is, by far, the best I’ve seen, because it’s been the most clear-eyed. I quoted a lot above, but there’s more, so please read the whole piece. But this one extra snippet from the piece puts it on the right scale:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Goldberg posited that today, despite Trump’s attacks on the
press, “we still have a free media,” to which Letterman
responded, “Do we?”</p>

<p>Dan Moren, Six Colors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The redesign is more than skin deep, however. Apple has rethought
the way some of its most fundamental interactions work. For
example, the increasingly long horizontal popover menus that hid
options behind an interminable scroll have morphed into a
dual-stage design. Tapping and holding on the screen brings up a
popover with a few common options, but it now doesn’t make you
scroll; instead, there’s an arrow indicating more options. Tap
that, and you’ll get a big pop-up panel of all the available
commands in a much easier-to-read and use format. As someone who
frequently finds himself swiping through a very long list to find
the one command I want (and somehow, it’s always the last one),
this is a tangible improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The big improvement here is that in the old popover (from iOS 3 — when copy and paste were finally added to iOS, and the popover typically only contained three or four items — until last year’s iOS 18), the scrolling you had to do was horizontal. And a lot of items were added to that menu over the years. And it wasn’t really <em>scrolling</em>, it was <em>panning</em>. And panning sideways through a long list of options is just a bad interaction experience. For me, a <em>lot</em> of the times I used this popover, I wanted the “Share...” command, and that was the last one, all the way on the right.</p>

<p>In iOS 26’s new tap-and-hold popover, it’s a vertical menu, just like a Mac contextual menu. And you don’t really have to scroll at all most of the time, because all the contextual menu options fit on screen. And even if you do have to scroll (which happens when the keyboard is open, reducing vertical screen real estate), you don’t have to scroll much to get to the bottom.</p>

<p>It’s one of the very best, most thoughtful, most useful changes in iOS 26. But also one of the most overdue: we know how contextual menus should be oriented. Vertically. We naturally make lists vertically, not horizontally. I sort of suspect Apple resisted making iOS contextual popovers vertical for so long because they didn’t want to make iOS more like a desktop computer OS.</p>

<p>My thanks to Dekáf Coffee Roasters for sponsoring last week at DF. Dekáf believes that people who drink coffee for its flavor are the true connoisseurs. While other roasters treat decaf as a side project, they’ve made it their entire mission. They’re dedicated to creating exceptional decaffeinated coffee that stands toe-to-toe with the world’s finest caffeinated beans.</p>

<p>I drink coffee every single day. I literally can’t remember the last day I didn’t have coffee in the morning. A few years ago, though, age started catching up to me and I stopped drinking coffee after lunch or so, lest it screw with my sleep. I really missed my afternoon coffee though. Why I didn’t think to try decaf I don’t know, but Dekáf sent me a few samples when they first sponsored DF back in April, and it’s been a revelation. In addition to fully decaffeinated roasts, they also have some half-decaffeinated roasts, and they’re absolutely delicious — my style of roast, for sure — <em>and</em> they don’t leave me jolted into the evening. Maybe you like tea, but I don’t. I like coffee, and I love being able to have a cup or two late in the afternoon again. It’s so good.</p>

<p>Also, I’m a big believer that you <em>can</em> judge a book by its cover. Just look at the Dekáf brand. It’s perfect. Color, typography, artwork — so cool, so spot-on for what they do.</p>

<p>Dekáf offers 9 single origins, 6 signature blends, and 4 Mizudashi cold brews (perfect for summer). All shipped to you within 24 hours of roasting. No shortcuts. You won’t believe it’s decaf. That’s the point. Even better, get 20% off with code: <strong>DF</strong>.</p>

<p>Hello dear readers. Daring Fireball has been silent for the last week. I realize how unusual it is for the site to go un-updated any week of the year, let alone this particular week of the year. I’m so sorry about that, and also sorry about not being able to write this note to you sooner.</p>

<p>I have been dealing with — and working through — a very personal situation for the past week. It’s OK. I’m going to be OK. But it has kept me offline for some time. Given the one-man nature of this site, that has meant that nothing has been published.</p>

<p>I look forward to getting back to writing very soon. I can feel it: I will be back soon. I’m itching to go. I mean, jiminy, it’s new iPhones week. But it’ll be a few more days before I get those reviews out. In the meantime, I so profoundly appreciate your patience and understanding.</p>

<p>Your faithful correspondent, <br />
John Gruber</p>

<p>Ben Thompson has a wonderful take on yesterday’s event and what it says about Apple overall:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple, to be fair, isn’t selling the same sugar water year-after-year in a zero sum war with other sugar water companies. Their sugar water is getting better, and I think this year’s seasonal concoction is particularly tasty. What is inescapable, however, is that while the company does still make new products — I definitely plan on getting new AirPod Pro 3s! — the company has, in the pursuit of easy profits, constrained the space in which it innovates.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal (gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Trump on Thursday led leaders of the world’s biggest
technology companies in a version of his cabinet meetings, in
which each participant takes a turn thanking and praising him,
this time for his efforts to promote investments in chip
manufacturing and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Tech titans including Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and OpenAI
CEO Sam Altman said “thank you” to the president, with some laying
out how much their companies plan to invest in the U.S.</p>

<p>“Thank you for being such a pro-business, pro-innovation
president. It’s a very refreshing change,” Altman said. “I think
it’s going to set us up for a long period of leading the world,
and that wouldn’t be happening without your leadership.”</p>

<p>Cook said Apple is expected to invest $600 billion in the U.S. “I
want to thank you for setting the tone such that we can make a
major investment in the United States and have some key
manufacturing here. I think it says a lot about your leadership
and focus on innovation,” Cook said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This whole thing was so weird. I know this sounds crazy, but I genuinely think these CEOs were unaware that this dinner was going to be open to the press and filmed. They’re all unprepared and awkward. Mark Zuckerberg didn’t know what number to declare for Meta’s upcoming US infrastructure spend. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRKLRtoQWyU">Tim Cook said this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to thank you for including me this evening. It’s incredible
to be among everyone here, particularly you and the first lady.
I’ve always enjoyed having dinner and interacting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are <em>not</em> prepared remarks. I mean, <em>what</em>? He enjoys “having dinner and interacting”?</p>

<p>I’m not going to argue that any of these CEOs, Cook included, are playing this situation right. But it really shows the profound power imbalance. The president of the United States is so astonishingly powerful. And Trump is wielding that power in unprecedented ways. This entire fiasco is embarrassing, but the criticism really ought to be directed at Trump.</p>

performance. We believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents
the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of

<p>That is, to say the least, an incredibly bold statement. But I think it’s true. This is a fascinating post, cogently written.</p>

<p>Tim Hardwick, MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the first time, every model in Apple’s latest flagship iPhone
17 lineup features a base 256GB storage capacity, up from the
lowest 128GB option in the iPhone 16 series. The regular iPhone 17
now comes in 256GB and 512GB storage options, while the all-new
ultra-thin iPhone Air and the iPhone 17 Pro come in 256GB, 512GB,
and 1TB capacities.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro Max is offered in the same three
capacities as the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro, but with the
addition of a maximum 2TB option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know it’s been 18 years, but it’s kind of wild to compare today’s storage tiers to the original iPhone’s 4, 8, and 16 GB options.</p>

	<summary type="text">These are the not the work of carpenters who care about the backs of the cabinets they’re building. These icons are so bad, they look like the work of untrained “How hard can it be?” dilettante carpenters who only last a few days on the job before sawing off one of their own fingers.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>MacOS has shipped with a collection of “utility” apps since the prehistoric era of classic Mac OS. A good rule of thumb for what makes an app a “utility” is that it’s a tool for doing something <em>to</em> or <em>about</em> your computer. Ever since Mac OS X 10.0, most of these apps have been neatly filed away in <em>/Applications/Utilities/</em>. Others — some because they’re obscure (e.g. Ticket Viewer), some because they’re effectively deprecated (e.g. DVD Player, whose copyright date in MacOS 15 Sequoia is 2019), and some because they present themselves, when launched, not as apps but as system-level features (e.g. About This Mac) — are tucked away in <em>/System/Library/CoreServices/</em> or <em>/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@BasicAppleGuy/115089810537348465">Basic Apple Guy posted a screenshot to Mastodon</a> comparing the current MacOS 15 icons for four of these utilities (Disk Utility, Expansion Slot Utility, Wireless Diagnostics, and AppleScript Utility) to their new icons in MacOS 26 Tahoe, beta 7 (click to enlarge for detail):</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/tahoe-utility-icons-via-basic-apple-guy.jpeg" class="noborder">
  <img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/tahoe-utility-icons-via-basic-apple-guy.jpeg"
    alt = "Screenshots of the MacOS 15 and MacOS 26 (beta 7) icons for Disk Utility, Expansion Slot Utility, Wireless Diagnostics, and AppleScript Utility."
    width = 500
  /></a></p>

<p>I don’t think the old icons for these apps from MacOS 15 were particularly good — Apple has mostly lost its “<a href="https://mastodon.social/@BasicAppleGuy/115050148901528749">icons</a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@BasicAppleGuy/115072885331562510">look</a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@BasicAppleGuy/114948306713250918">cool</a>” game. But the new ones in MacOS 26 Tahoe are objectively terrible. The only one of this bunch that’s maybe sort of OK is Wireless Diagnostics. They all look like placeholder icons made by a developer who would be the first to admit that they’re not an artist. Disk Utility, which is an important app, doesn’t even look like it involves a disk.</p>

<p>These new icons all use the same “wrench” motif, which is a lazy, limiting concept to start with. Tahoe, at the system level, enforces a squircle shape on all application icons. Apps that haven’t been updated with Tahoe-compliant everything-fits-in-a-squircle icons are put in “<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/08/macos-tahoe-fix-gray-box-icons/">squircle jail</a>” — their non-Tahoe-compliant icons are shrunk and placed atop a drab gray Tahoe squircle background, to force them into squircle compliance. But these Apple utility apps have an entire sub-motif — inside their base squircle shape is a large wrench fitted against a bolt. Only inside the bolt — which is inside the wrench’s jaws, which wrench is inside the squircle — goes the part of the icon that identifies the app itself. So maybe like 10 percent of the area of the icon is the area where the app can show something that identifies its purpose.</p>

<p>So the entire concept for these icons sucks. But the conceptual execution sucks too. The wrench is incredibly stupid-looking. Whoever drew it has obviously never used an open-end wrench because the jaws on the wrench head are <em>way</em> too thin. They’d break off under any significant torque. Just look at a real-life wrench, or just <a href="https://mastodon.social/@BasicAppleGuy/115092733884236020">look at the wrench heads in the older MacOS icons</a> (or Apple’s 🔧 emoji, for that matter).</p>

<p>Individually the icons mostly suck too:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Disk Utility — a very important app — has an icon that’s just an Apple logo (inside the bolt that’s inside the wrench that’s inside the squircle). Not a hard disk, not an external drive, not an SD card. Just an Apple logo. If I just showed you this icon without telling you which app it represented, how in the world could you guess what it is? Even if you know the “Apple utility app icon” motif of the big dumb wrench and bolt, the best you could guess is “a utility app for something Apple-related” which, for an Apple computer, could be anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Expansion Slot Utility — This app only runs on Mac Pros because Mac Pros are the only Macs with expansion slots. So the old icon naturally shows a Mac Pro. The new icon shows ... three rectangular empty sockets?</p></li>
<li><p>AppleScript Utility — A fine concept for this icon (within the confines of the terrible wrench-and-bolt utility icon concept). Everyone who knows AppleScript knows the scroll that represents AppleScript scripts. So just put the iconic AppleScript scroll in the bolt in the wrench in the squircle. But here, the placement of the scroll is botched — it’s rotated a few degrees counterclockwise. It makes the scroll look like it’s falling over. Here’s how the scroll is canonically oriented, via the glyphs in SF Symbols:</p>

<p><img
  src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/applescript-icons-sf-symbols.png"
  alt = "The “applescript” and “applescript.fill” icon glyphs from the SF Symbols font."
/></p>

<p>and via the default icon for a script application (with a line added showing the center):</p>

<p>It’s wrong.</p></li>

<p>These are not the work of carpenters <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/445621-when-you-re-a-carpenter-making-a-beautiful-chest-of-drawers">who care about the backs of the cabinets</a> they’re building. These icons are so bad, they look like the work of untrained “How hard can it be?” dilettante carpenters who only last a few days on the job before sawing off one of their own fingers. The whole collection looks like the work from someone with no artistic ability <em>nor</em> an eye for detail. From <em>Apple</em>, of all companies.</p>

<p>Is it a big deal in the grand scheme of things that the icons for these seldom-used utility apps have gone to shit? No. But consider the proverbial canary in a coal mine. The problem isn’t that one little bird has died. The problem is that the bird might be dead because the whole mine is filling with deadly carbon monoxide or highly flammable methane gas. The icons in <em>/Applications/Utilities/</em> in MacOS 26 Tahoe represent a folder full of dead canaries. </p>

	<summary type="text">The oddest part about the whole situation is that CNBC is being spun out into Versant, too, but while they’re losing the NBC peacock logo, they’re just keeping their name, unchanged.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/08/18/msnbc-rebrand-ms-now-versant">Sara Fischer, Axios</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MSNBC, the progressive cable network owned by NBCUniversal, is
rebranding to MS NOW, an acronym that stands for My Source for
News, Opinion and the World.</p>

<p>The rebrand is part of a wider effort by NBCU to create a
distinction between the cable networks it plans to spin out and
the remaining NBCU parent company. As part of the rebrand, select
cable networks that will be spun out into <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/10/all-eyes-on-versant-media-trends">Versant</a>, including
CNBC, Golf Channel, GolfNow, MSNBC and SportsEngine, will all
drop the iconic peacock logo that has for decades served as
NBCU’s logo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a lot to unpack here. First, “Versant” itself is a pretty bad name (feels so vague — seems like the name of a fake company in a movie or TV show) so it’s no surprise that the same nitwits are botching Versant’s rebranded properties. But given that NBCUniversal is apparently forcing MSNBC to take the “NBC” out of its name, “MSNOW” isn’t a bad new name. But it’s not a <em>good</em> new name either. And they’re apparently using a space: “MS NOW”, yet <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/msnbc-new-name-ms-now-1236491621/">also seem confused</a> (or haven’t even decided yet) whether it’s supposed to be pronounced letter-by-letter (<em>em ess en oh dubya</em>) or as two letters and a word (<em>em ess now</em>). Saying the “NOW” as the word <em>now</em> makes sense for a 24/7 channel, but if it’s a word, the whole name should be styled “MS Now”. (Fox News styles their name as “FOX News” in some places, but never pretends the f-o-x is an acronym.)</p>

<p>The “My Source News Opinion World” backronym is so dumb it boggles the mind. I genuinely wonder if someone had ChatGPT do that. You can have a series of letters as a name — especially as a TV channel — without those letters really standing for anything. CNN is technically an acronym for “Cable News Network” but they’ve effectively just been “CNN” for decades now. The name “MSNBC” came from the fact that, at launch in the 1990s, <a href="https://www.threads.com/@mossbergwalt/post/DNipvTJt4HW">it debuted as a collaboration</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_MSNBC:_1996–2007">between Microsoft’s MSN and NBC News</a>. But Microsoft hasn’t been involved with the cable channel <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-dec-24-fi-msnbc24-story.html">for 20 years</a> — the “MS” in “MSNBC” hasn’t stood for anything since 2005. (In fact, MSN itself is another good example. It originally stood for “Microsoft Network”, even though Microsoft has never styled their name with a camel-cased <em>S</em>.<sup id="fnr1-2025-08-20"><a href="#fn1-2025-08-20">1</a></sup> But it’s really just “MSN” now.)<sup id="fnr2-2025-08-20"><a href="#fn2-2025-08-20">2</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://www.threads.com/@tomgara/post/DNgNQeQOlIB">Tom Gara, writing on Threads</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only real fuck up with the MSNBC rebrand is that they made up
a dumb sounding fake acronym. It’s completely unnecessary! Just
say “we’re changing our name to MS NOW to reflect the urgency of
the moment.” Nobody has ever thought about what the old acronym
stood for and nobody needed a new fake one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There <em>is</em> another fuck up, though: the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/msnow.png">logo</a> is atrocious. What is that flag? It looks like the Austrian flag (🇦🇹), not America’s. But are we sure it even <em>is</em> a flag? Maybe it’s a paper receipt and the red stripes are those marks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DollarGeneral/comments/p7sl4t/why_does_the_printer_do_the_pink_streak_near_the/">when it’s time to replace the roll</a>? <a href="https://www.threads.com/@jonathanhoefler/post/DNk64Vxgah-">Jonathan Hoefler, on Threads</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My personal benchmark for a logo is that it shouldn’t look like a
pension fund.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The oddest part about the whole situation is that CNBC is being spun out into Versant, too, but while they’re losing the NBC peacock logo, they’re just keeping their name, unchanged. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/comcast-versant-rename-msnbc-peacock-logos.html">From CNBC’s own coverage of MSNBC’s rebranding</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While MSNBC and NBC News will have duplications in coverage,
CNBC’s news organization is already separate enough from NBC News
that executives decided it didn’t need a name change. Also,
technically, the “NBC” in “CNBC” never stemmed from National
Broadcasting Co. Rather, CNBC stands for “Consumer News and
Business Channel.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lastly, shoutout to M.G. Siegler for <a href="https://spyglass.org/ms-now-msnbc/">coining the term <em>peacockblocked</em></a> to describe MSNBC’s branding plight.</p>

<p>Historical pedantry: from 1975–1979, <a href="https://logos.fandom.com/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft spelled its name “Micro-Soft”</a>, with, yes, an uppercase <em>S</em>.

<p>If I’d been in the room, my spitball idea for a new name would have been MNC. Take out every other letter to break both the NBC <em>and</em> Microsoft connotations, but leave behind an acronym that looks and sounds like a tighter, more efficient version of MSNBC. If they really insisted that the acronym stand for something, it could be Modern (or Major?) News Channel.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2025-08-20"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

	<summary type="text">Long story short: there’s an “iPhone” menu under “Widgets” in System Settings → Desktop &amp; Dock.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I’ve been using two iPhones throughout the summer — one running iOS 18, the other running iOS 26 betas. I found myself wanting to switch between them with iPhone Mirroring on my Mac, but couldn’t figure out how. The answer, from Apple Support, “<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120421">iPhone Mirroring: Use your iPhone from your Mac</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have more than one iPhone that is both signed in to your
Apple Account and nearby, you can choose the one that your Mac
uses for mirroring and iPhone notifications:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Choose Apple menu  > System Settings, then click Desktop &amp;
Dock in the sidebar.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose your iPhone from the iPhone pop-up menu on the right.
This menu appears just below the “Use iPhone widgets” setting.
It appears only when your Mac detects more than one nearby
iPhone that can be used for mirroring.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>That pop-up menu is about halfway down the screen in Desktop &amp; Dock, in the “Widgets” section.<sup id="fnr1-2025-08-19"><a href="#fn1-2025-08-19">1</a></sup> I suspected this was possible, but I had to search the web (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/try_switching_to_kagi">via Kagi</a>, the best search engine in the world, of course) to find the answer. I never would have thought to look in System Settings → Desktop &amp; Dock, let alone, even if I happened to look in that panel, all the way down under “Widgets”.</p>

<p>Places where I <em>did</em> look:</p>

<ul>
<li>On the Mac, in the iPhone Mirroring app’s own Settings window. Nope.</li>
<li>On the iPhone, in Settings → General → Airplay &amp; Continuity. This is where you can control which Mac or Macs your iPhone is available from with iPhone Mirroring (e.g. you can go here to revoke access from a certain Mac), but it doesn’t help you change which iPhone, among multiple, that any particular Mac connects to.</li>
</ul>

<p>To Apple’s credit, searching for “mirroring” in MacOS System Settings <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/macos-18.6-settings-desktop-dock.png">does lead you to the correct setting</a>, but because it’s under “Widget settings”, I suspect some people who search for “mirroring” here will see that in the results list and not even bother clicking it, because “Widget settings” at first doesn’t sound like where you should go to choose between multiple phones for iPhone Mirroring. (It kind of makes sense, when you realize that the same iPhone that provides widgets to your Mac is the one available for iPhone Mirroring to connect to.)</p>

<p>To Apple’s discredit, Siri is no help, despite Apple Intelligence’s supposed <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/26/this-is-every-apple-intelligence-feature-thats-available-now/">ability to harness “product knowledge”</a> from LLM training on Apple’s own support documents. After asking Siri, “How do I use multiple iPhones with iPhone mirroring?” on either a Mac or iPhone, I get a brief answer that says “You can set up more than one iPhone to use iPhone Mirroring with your Mac, but you can only connect to one iPhone at a time”, with a link to the iPhone User Guide that opens in the Tips app. That page in the iPhone User Guide, however — also available on the web as “<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-your-iphone-from-your-mac-mchl444d53a6/mac">Control Your iPhone From Your Mac</a>” — doesn’t contain any mention of using more than one iPhone with iPhone Mirroring. So <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120421">this Apple Support document</a> on iPhone Mirroring does explain it (that’s the one I linked to at the top of this post), but <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-your-iphone-from-your-mac-mchl444d53a6/mac">this one does not</a>. No wonder Apple Intelligence’s “product knowledge”, trained on these documents, is somewhat confused.</p>

<p>But it gets worse. I gave Siri a second chance on my Mac, asking the same question, something along the lines of “How do I use multiple iPhones with iPhone mirroring?” (I can’t be sure exactly which words I used because Siri doesn’t show a chat transcript<sup id="fnr2-2025-08-19"><a href="#fn2-2025-08-19">2</a></sup>), and the second time, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/siri-mirroring-nonsense.png">it responded thus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To use multiple iPhones with iPhone Mirroring:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the iPhone Mirroring app on your Mac.</li>
<li>Click the “Connect” button.</li>
<li>Enter your iPhone passcode and choose how to authenticate.</li>
<li>Select the iPhone you want to use from the list of available
iPhones.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This answer certainly describes one possible way that using multiple iPhones with iPhone Mirroring <em>should</em> work, but as an answer for how it actually <em>does</em> work, it’s abject nonsense. There is no “list of available iPhones” in the iPhone Mirroring app. If there were such a list to choose from, I’d never have had a question about this whole fucking thing in the first place.</p>

<p>The first time I looked in the Desktop & Dock panel in System Settings, there was no “iPhone” pop-up menu visible, despite the fact that both of my active iPhones were on my desk, right next to my MacBook Pro. But I remembered that in the last few days, I’d been having problems with <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102430">Continuity’s Universal Clipboard</a> feature too. In the past, when Universal Clipboard has gone on the fritz, I’ve solved the problem by toggling Bluetooth off and back on. I toggled Bluetooth on my Mac and boom, the “iPhone” menu appeared in the Desktop & Dock panel in System Settings, with the pop-up menu correctly listing both of my active iPhones. Universal Clipboard started working correctly again too. I bet the <em>next</em> version of Bluetooth is actually going to be reliable.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-08-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

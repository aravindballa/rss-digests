<p>My sincere thanks to The Ole Independence Hall Hooligans for sponsoring this past week at DF to promote democracy. That’s it. A real sponsorship, real money, raised by a group of readers who simply wanted the ad space on DF to promote, as they described it, “the enduring and aspirational project that is democracy.”</p>

<p>In <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/03/democracy">their sponsored RSS entry</a> to start the week, they quoted <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript">the preamble to the US Constitution</a>. I’ll go a decade earlier, and quote from <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript">the Declaration of Independence</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of
repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the
establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove
this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>

<p>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and
necessary for the public good. [...]</p>

<p>He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of
their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. [...]</p>

<p>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</p>

<p>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:</p>

<p>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:</p>

<p>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended
offences:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/trump-claims-to-extend-tiktok-deadline-for-another-75-days">Sounds</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/glasser-trump-ego">like</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/05/us/trump-news-tariffs#justice-dept-immigration-lawyer-leave">someone</a> in the news today (and yesterday, and alas, surely again tomorrow). There is no greater threat to democracy itself than a delusional mad king, whether he wears a crown or a ridiculous ugly red cap. Take action and make your voice heard now — democracy in action is democracy’s only defense.</p>

<p>David Remnick, in a fine short piece for The New Yorker on Signalgate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is an Administration that does not have to slip on a Signal
banana peel to reveal its deepest-held prejudices and its painful
incapacities. You get the sense that we would learn little if we
were privy to a twenty-four-hour-a-day live stream of its every
private utterance. Part of what was so appalling about Trump and
Vance’s recent meeting with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> was not
just their penchant for channelling the world view and negotiating
points of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> but their comfort in expressing
them, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/newsletter/the-daily/trump-and-zelenskys-stunning-fight"><em>barking</em> them</a>, at the Ukrainian President in front
of reporters in the Oval Office.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stupidity and ignorance as a governing style. That’s it. They are <em>exactly</em> who they claim they are, and in private speak how they do in public. There is no secret plan.</p>

<p>These idiots do not believe polluting the atmosphere with carbon emissions has caused calamitous damage to our climate, despite the fact that experts, decades ago, almost universally predicted it would. Few issues in science had as much expert consensus.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/03/thompson-no-vaxxers">These idiots think vaccines</a> — one of the great breakthroughs in the history of science and medicine — are a bigger health risk than the diseases they immunize against. Now there are unvaccinated American kids dying from measles, a disease that was effectively wiped out in the modern world by the time I was born.</p>

<p>Now they’re bringing the same sort of idiocy, unbound by critical thinking, history, or anything recognized as economic expertise, to trade policy.</p>

<p>Terrific photos and summary coverage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/apr/05/hands-off-protests-trump-administration">from The Guardian</a>. Additional coverage from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/anti-trump-protests-hands-off.html">The New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/04/05/hands-off-protest-trump-washington/">Washington Post</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/05/us/hands-off-protests-trump-musk/index.html">CNN</a>. <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2025/04/photos-nationwide-protests-against-trump-and-musk/682320/">The Atlantic has a great collection of photos</a> from dozens of cities.</p>

<p>There’s something so bizarrely asymmetrical about Trump’s political support. We saw large scale protests like today’s starting in 2017 too, and in this 2.0 administration, they’re only going to get bigger. Today’s protests were coast-to-coast, in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/peterbowdenlive.bsky.social/post/3lm3ahz5pp22d">cities</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/peterbowdenlive.bsky.social/post/3lm3ahz5pp22d">large</a> and <a href="https://me.dm/@mgs/114286204556855230">small</a>. Hundreds of thousands — correction, <em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/05/us/hands-off-protests-trump-musk/index.html">millions</a></em> — of people. Huge crowd <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mandiaholly/post/DIFRGyoPd_i?xmt=AQGzI-Oy3kcvBP6Lg5mLyKE0RO6Vnjit3SUnIMLATFjV3A">in Philadelphia</a>. Over 100,000 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/peterbowdenlive.bsky.social/post/3lm3ahz5pp22d">in Boston</a>. But there were never any protests at all against the Biden administration. Trump’s support has been just wide enough to win, twice, but it’s so thin. His first inauguration was <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2017/01/the-facts-on-crowd-size/">so conspicuously sparsely attended</a> they held the second one indoors. Support for democracy runs deep.</p>

<p>Joanna Stern, Adrienne Tong, and Nicole Nguyen, writing for The Wall Street Journal (<a href="https://apple.news/AZx1sTNZuRg-d7hf8O69F5A">News+</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take a look at this iPhone 16 Pro. Your cost, for the 256GB
version, is $1,100. The cost of all the hardware inside — aka the
bill of materials — was about $550 to Apple when the phone was
introduced, says Wayne Lam, research analyst at TechInsights,
which breaks down major products. Throw in assembly and testing
and Apple’s cost rises to around $580. Even when you account for
Apple’s advertising budget and all the included services — iMessage, iCloud, etc. — there’s still a healthy profit margin.</p>

<p>Now factor in the newly announced tariff for goods from China,
which currently totals 54%. The cost rises to around $850. That
profit margin would shrink dramatically if Apple didn’t up the
price. And you don’t become a trillion-dollar gadget company by
charging for things at cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also worth a look is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/04/wsj-front-page-5-april-2025.jpeg">today’s front page of the WSJ print edition</a>. At least they picked a flattering photo of Trump.</p>

<p>Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In his piece, Gruber particularly calls out the trashcan Mac Pro
sticking at $2999 throughout its existence, but I think an even
more striking example is the iMac. Introduced in 1998 at a base
price of $1299, today’s infinitely more powerful iMac M4 starts at
… $1299.</p>

<p>Granted, with inflation, those prices would be a little different.
In researching the details, I came across <a href="https://www.perfectrec.com/posts/iMac-price-history">this great piece from
PerfectRec</a> charting the iMac’s price history over the years,
including adjusting for inflation. Impressively, while the iMac’s
base price has dipped as low as $1099 in all that time, it’s never
gone <em>over</em> $1299.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a great example. And bringing inflation into the mix is a key factor I neglected to make <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/unchanging_prices_vs_nonsensical_tariffs">yesterday</a>. Moore’s Law makes computers very strange manufactured goods. A Honda Civic LX cost about $15,000 in 1998, but now costs about $25,000. BMW 3-series sedans went from around $30,000 to $45,000. But the iMac still starts at $1,299.</p>

<p>Pricing stability is a way that Apple keeps these two forces — Moore’s Law and inflation — in balance.</p>

<p>Barbara Moens and Henry Foy, reporting from Brussels for the Financial Times <em>last</em> Friday, March 28:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The EU is set to impose minimal fines on Apple and Facebook owner
Meta next week under its Digital Markets Act, as Brussels seeks to
avoid escalating tensions with US President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>According to people familiar with the decisions, the iPhone maker
is expected to be fined and ordered to revise its App Store rules,
following an investigation into whether they prevent app
developers from sending consumers to offers outside its platform.
Regulators will also close another investigation into Apple, which
was focused on the company’s design of its web browser choice
screen without any further sanctions.</p>

<p>Meta will also be fined and ordered to change its “pay or consent”
model which forces users to either consent to data tracking or pay
a subscription fee for an ad-free experience of its products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FT is usually the go-to source for leaked news from the European Commission. But “next week” came and went with no announcements made. Maybe the FT just had a bad source, or maybe there was some sort of unforeseen delay? Or maybe the EC looked at the chaos unleashed by Trump this week and figured these fines could wait another week. Or maybe they’re just recalculating the fines post-trade-war.</p>

<p>Tom Warren, reporting for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft held a special 50th anniversary event at its
headquarters earlier today. During Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa
Suleyman’s presentation, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643670/microsoft-employee-protest-50th-annivesary-ai">Microsoft employee interrupted the
event</a> to protest the use of Microsoft’s technologies in
Israel’s war against Hamas. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643777/microsoft-bill-gates-steve-ballmer-satya-nadella-employee-protestor">A second employee interrupted the
event later on</a>, while CEO Satya Nadella, co-founder Bill
Gates, and former CEO Steve Ballmer were discussing 50 years of
Microsoft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only opinionated <em>public</em> takes I’ve seen on these two protestors are from political extremes: a small number of people cheering them on, and another small number of people angrily decrying them as terrorist sympathizers. I suspect most people, though, have a take closer to my own, but are unwilling to espouse it lest they risk the ire of the two aforementioned political extremes. I’ll try.</p>

<p>There’s a time and a place for everything, and Microsoft’s own 50th anniversary celebration was not the time or place for two insufferable self-involved showboats to make the event about them. Because that’s what this was. It was about them, personally. Not about Gaza or Israel.</p>

<p>The place for righteous protests is in public, in the streets — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/apr/05/hands-off-protests-trump-administration">exactly as they are happening across the United States today</a>.</p>

<p>Of <em>course</em> Microsoft conducts business in Israel and with the Israeli government. They’re Microsoft — the entire point of the company (and thus the core point of the 50th anniversary celebration) is that their software is ubiquitous. Ranked by GDP, Israeli’s economy is 29th in the world. If Microsoft employees really want to make the case that the company should sever all ties to Israel, go ahead, but performance stunts at public celebrations are not the way. Why do they even work for Microsoft if they’re not happy to celebrate the company’s own 50th anniversary? Why did Microsoft hire people who seemingly despise the very company they work for?</p>

<p>I don’t know if you’ve heard but there’s a lot of horrible shit going on around the world right now. Should Microsoft sever all ties to Republican-led states that have made women’s reproductive healthcare illegal? (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/georgia-arrest-miscarriage-fetal-personhood-rcna199400">A woman in Georgia was just arrested after suffering a miscarriage</a>.) Should Microsoft sever all ties to the U.S. federal government, which is now led by a mad tyrant who, in plain sight, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/16/what-the-january-6th-report-is-missing">attempted to overthrow an election he lost</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752">now claims</a> (shocking no one) to be considering running for a third term that <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-22/">even a child could understand to be plainly unconstitutional</a>? How much Microsoft software does ICE use? Or DOGE?</p>

<p>Where do such protests — all in the name of just causes — stop?</p>

<p>In the midst of all this madness and chaos — much of it already horrific, more of it suggestive of foreboding horrors to come — we need more than ever to savor, to appreciate, what’s still good about the world. Microsoft is a great American company. What a remarkable gift of good luck, good health, brilliant strategy, successful execution, steady leadership, and the right circumstances (e.g. Bill Gates’s precocious age — 19! — at the company’s founding) that the company has had only three CEOs in its half-century history and all three were available to join each other on stage to celebrate this anniversary, and the company’s still-bright future.</p>

<p>What a shitty thing to do it was to try to spoil this.</p>

<p>Susan Glasser, writing for The New Yorker, “Donald Trump’s Ego Melts the Global Economy”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this new political moment of the unthinkable made manifest, the
sheer power rush for Trump should also not be underestimated.
Imagine his joy as he sat down to sign an executive order
decreeing the new tariffs on the basis of sweeping powers he may
or may not legally possess to declare a “national economic
emergency” — here was Trump transforming the world with a single
flourish of his Sharpie pen. “It’s such an honor to be finally
able to do this,” he said. At what other moment in modern times
has a single man wielded so much unaccountable power over such a
large swath of the world economy? There are whole businesses
devoted to risk analysis for corporations; this is a situation in
which Trump himself is the risk and the crisis being analyzed is
one that he created. Talk about an ego trip.</p>

<p>Glasser links to <a href="https://x.com/Kasparov63/status/1907798003236188169">Garry Kasparov, on X</a>, responding to Wall Street’s collective surprise that Trump did what he’s been saying he would do re: tariff policy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As I’ve said for years about Putin, and which applies to other
autocratic personalities like Trump: “Dictators always lie about
what they’ve done, but are often quite plain about what they want
to do.” “Trump would never...” is the new “Putin would never...”</p>

<p>Such people do and take whatever they can, unless they are
stopped. That they don’t always succeed does not mean they were
not sincere in their ambitions and won’t keep trying to fulfill
them. Trump has only been emboldened by the sycophantic GOP this
time around.</p>

<p>CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Donald Trump on Friday extended a deadline requiring China-based ByteDance to sell the U.S. operations of TikTok or face an effective ban in the country, marking the second time he has taken such action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump, on Truth Social, which is by far the most popular social network in the world:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE
TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires
more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is
why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running
for an additional 75 days. We hope to continue working in Good
Faith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our
Reciprocal Tariffs (Necessary for Fair and Balanced Trade between
China and the U.S.A.!). This proves that Tariffs are the most
powerful Economic tool, and very important to our National
Security! We do not want TikTok to “go dark.” We look forward to
working with TikTok and China to close the Deal. Thank you for
your attention to this matter!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are the remarks of the most powerful man in the world.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, too, that there is no mechanism in the law for the president to issue any such extension. What he’s saying is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok">what he said the last time</a>: he’s instructing Attorney General Pam Bondi not to enforce the law, and pinky-swearing that U.S. companies that are breaking the law to keep TikTok available (Akamai, Oracle, Google, Apple) <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/my_spitball_theory_on_tiktoks_current_semi-reprieve_in_the_us">won’t be held responsible for it</a>. It’s just a complete abdication of the rule of law.</p>

<p>Not a peep from Republican Tom Cotton, who, on the cusp of Trump taking office again, <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-ricketts-statement-on-tiktok-being-removed-from-app-stores">was crowing about the PAFACA Act coming into effect to shut TikTok down in the US</a>.</p>

<p>From that same Reuters report by Akash Sriram <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/unchanging_prices_vs_nonsensical_tariffs">that I just wrote about</a>, speculating that iPhone prices might rise dramatically under Trump’s tariffs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, other analysts noted that iPhone sales have been
floundering in the company’s major markets, as Apple
Intelligence, a suite of features that helps summarize
notifications, rewrite emails and give users access to ChatGPT,
has failed to enthuse buyers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Merriam-Webster defines <em><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flounder">flounder</a></em> thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>: to struggle to move or obtain footing : thrash about wildly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s Jason Snell’s chart of iPhone sales <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/01/apples-reports-record-revenue-for-q1-2025/">through their most recent quarterly report</a> — a record-breaking quarter for the company overall — covering the last three calendar months of 2024:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/04/iphone-revenue-q1-2025-six-colors.png" class="noborder">
<img
  src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/04/iphone-revenue-q1-2025-six-colors.png"
  alt = "Chart showing remarkably flat, stable, consistent iPhone sales since 2022."
/></a></p>

<p>It’s certainly up for debate whether Apple Intelligence is an effective marketing driver for iPhone sales. I mean that with no snark. Maybe Apple Intelligence <em>is</em> driving iPhone sales. I don’t know why people have purchased new iPhones in the last six months. Neither do you, and neither do the “other analysts” (conveniently unnamed) cited by Reuters. But what we do know, because Apple reports the revenue numbers, is that iPhone sales have been remarkably flat, year-over-year, for the last 13 quarters.</p>

	<summary type="text">The erratic, illogical, nonsensical nature of Trump’s tariffs is bad for everyone. (Understatement.) But it’s particularly troublesome for a company that sees retail price stability as part of the branding for its products.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Akash Sriram, reporting for Reuters under the headline “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/will-trump-tariffs-make-apple-iphones-more-expensive-2025-04-03/">A $2,300 Apple iPhone? Trump Tariffs Could Make That Happen.</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most iPhones are still made in China, which was hit with a 54%
tariff. If those levies persist, Apple has a tough choice: absorb
the extra expense or pass it on to customers.</p>

<p>Shares of the company closed down 9.3% on Thursday, hitting their
worst day since March 2020.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple shares dropped <em>another</em> 7.3% percent today. Apple alone has lost 16.6% of its value in the last 48 hours; the S&amp;P 500 dropped 10%.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cheapest iPhone 16 model was launched in the U.S. with a
sticker price of $799, but could cost as much as $1,142, per
calculations based on projections from analysts at Rosenblatt
Securities, who say the cost could rise by 43% — if Apple is able
to pass that on to consumers. A more expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max,
with a 6.9-inch display and 1 terabyte of storage, which currently
retails at $1599, could cost nearly $2300 if a 43% increase were
to pass to consumers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s under-remarked upon, but Apple, to a point of almost obstinance, considers pricing part of the brand for its products. They tend not to raise or lower prices with the ebbs and flows of the world economy or even the obvious constraints of simple supply and demand. Throughout the entire COVID crisis, I don’t recall them changing their prices for anything.</p>

<p>As an extreme example, consider the trashcan Mac Pro. It was introduced <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2013/06/10Apple-Gives-Sneak-Peek-Into-the-Future-of-the-Pro-Desktop/">at WWDC 2013</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2013/10/23Introducing-the-All-New-Mac-Pro-The-Most-Radical-Mac-Ever/">shipped in December that year</a> with a starting price of $2,999. It then went <a href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/833730471804731392">over three years without an update</a> — and still cost $2,999. Then in April 2017 Apple held <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/04/the_mac_pro_lives">that highly unusual small roundtable meeting</a> — invitees were just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/apple-pushes-the-reset-button-on-the-mac-pro/">Matthew Panzarino</a>, <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/04/04/apple-reveals-mac-pro-imac-plans/">Lance Ulanoff</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/apple-to-ditch-the-current-mac-pro-design-but-replacement-wont-arrive--2343465726.html">Ina Fried</a>, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/apple-says-it-is-completely-rethinking-the-mac-pro">John Paczkowski</a>, and yours truly — to discuss “completely rethinking the Mac Pro”. They issued small speed bumps to the trashcan Mac Pro that day, but didn’t ship the actual completely-rethought Mac Pro <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/apple-unveils-powerful-all-new-mac-pro-and-groundbreaking-pro-display-xdr/">until WWDC 2019</a>. The starting price never changed from $2,999, even when demand for the trashcan models had clearly dropped to near zero. The price was part of the brand. (The starting price for the 2019 Mac Pro: $5,999.)</p>

<p>Or consider <em>today’s</em> Mac Pro, with the M2 Ultra. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/apple-unveils-new-mac-studio-and-brings-apple-silicon-to-mac-pro/">It debuted alongside Mac Studio models that also came with the M2 Ultra</a> at WWDC 2023 almost two years ago. M2 Ultra Mac Studios <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/06/m2-ultra-mac-studio-review-top-of-the-line/">started at $3,999</a>; Mac Pros at $6,999. Many observers, quite reasonably, questioned the $3,000 price difference when both computers offered the same chips. The 2023 Mac Pro, in some sense, is just a 2023 Mac Studio in a much bigger case with additional high-performance I/O options. But a month ago Apple debuted <em>M3</em> Ultra Mac Studios, with an unchanged starting price of $3,999. The Mac Pro, still equipped with the older M2 Ultra, still starts at $6,999. Which means that for the time being, you’re not paying $3,000 extra for the same computer in a bigger case, but for a <em>generation-older</em> computer in a bigger case.</p>

<p>Presumably, M3 Ultra Mac Pros are coming soon, perhaps at WWDC. But until then, the pricing is undeniably weird when compared to the Mac Studio — and many people have thought the pricing was a bit weird compared to the Mac Studio when they were offered with the same M2-generation chips. But that’s how Apple likes to do pricing: they set a price when a product is announced, and that price never changes until a successor to that product is announced.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-techdirt">erratic</a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-day-two">illogical</a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/the-economist-on-trumps-mindless-tariffs">nonsensical</a> nature of Trump’s tariffs is bad for everyone. (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/crampell.bsky.social/post/3llzc3fmf7s23">Understatement</a>.) But it’s particularly troublesome for a company that sees retail price stability as part of the branding for its products. Will Trump come to his senses (to some small degree), and declare a nonexistent victory next week and pull these tariffs from the board? Or stick to his guns and ride this global-economy-tanking insanity out? No one knows. Will he start granting exceptions? No one knows. So in addition to being nonsensical, the whole thing is entirely unpredictable, which is not at all compatible with the way Apple has set retail prices for decades.</p>

<p>My (bigly) guess is that Apple will inject its own predictability and stability into the mix, and keep its retail prices stable, for now, and take the tariff hit on its margins. But if these tariffs really stay in effect, even just for a few months, at current prices Apple <a href="https://www.threads.net/@benedictevans/post/DIBMlA2MSFs">would be breaking even at best</a>, and likely losing money, on each iPhone it sells.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mike Isaac, writing for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple, Dell, Oracle — which rely on hardware and global supply
chains that are in the direct line of fire from tariffs — saw
their shares go into free-fall. But there was another big tech
company whose stock took a pummeling even though its core business
has little to do with hardware: Meta. [...]</p>

<p>The effect of tariffs on Meta’s ad business is simple. Many of
its small and medium-sized advertisers are from all across the
world. President Trump’s tariffs will instantly make it more
expensive for them to sell their products to customers in the
United States. [...]</p>

<p>Last year, the company disclosed that 10 percent of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/business/google-meta-temu-shein.html">its revenue in
2023 was from Chinese companies spending heavily</a> on advertising
across Facebook and Instagram, an ad blitz aimed at garnering a
foothold in lucrative Western markets.</p>

<p>Much of that growth was fueled by the explosive expansion of the
fast-fashion company Shein — which is based in Singapore but has
a supply chain that is largely in China — and the e-commerce app
Temu, a low-cost, Amazon-like company owned by the Chinese
e-commerce conglomerate Pinduoduo. Temu was estimated to have
spent $3 billion in marketing costs in 2023 alone, according to
estimates from Bernstein Research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the stock market began crumbling after Trump’s announcement Wednesday, I didn’t get why Meta was being hit so hard. Meta makes devices, but unlike Apple, that’s just a side hustle. Meta isn’t a retailer like Amazon. But Meta <em>is</em> a huge advertising destination for retailers. It’s all interconnected.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Allison McDaniel, writing for 9to5Mac back in 2022:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-cash/">Apple Cash</a> is a virtual debit card where you can send and
receive money through iMessage. Stored in your Wallet, you can
make secure and contactless payments with Apple Pay from your
iPhone or Apple Watch. It’s also a way to receive daily cash back
for those who use Apple Card. Previously a Discover card, your
Apple Cash card is now Visa.</p>

<p>Spotted by user <a href="https://x.com/Kanjo/status/1517427755553804288">@Kanjo on Twitter</a>, it’s easy to notice the
card has a visible Visa logo in the bottom right corner. Before
this change, there was no Discover logo on the card. While not
everyone will like the addition of the logo, it’s going to be hard
to forget it’s a Visa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Apple Card is a credit card, with Goldman Sachs as the bank and Mastercard as the network. Apple definitely needs a new banking partner, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/goldman-apple-card-losses">as Goldman is exiting the consumer banking business</a>, and is rumored to be listening to offers from Visa and Amex to switch its network too.</p>

<p>Apple Cash is a debit card, which launched on the Discover network but switched to Visa three years ago — presumably with a nice kickback to Apple to get that Visa logo on the virtual cards in Wallet.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/via-mastercard-apple-card">observed yesterday</a> that, in general, Visa and Mastercard credit cards are both accepted at the same locations. The most notable exception is Costco, which, as part of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/visa-wanted-a-vast-empire-first-it-had-to-beat-back-its-foes-3b3067f3?mod=article_inline">the deal to make its own credit card a Visa</a> (after long partnering with Amex), only accepts Visa credit cards at its physical retail locations and gas stations. They accept “most PIN-based debit/ATM cards”, but for credit, only Visa.</p>

<p>Online, for reasons I don’t understand, Costco accepts Mastercard too (which they incorrectly style in camelcase — you’d think Costco, of all companies, would be sensitive to wrongly camelcased mid-name C’s). Also, in Canada’s Costcos, it’s reversed, with Mastercard being exclusive in-store but Visa being accepted online.</p>

<p>Another high-profile exception: <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/visa-on-the-road-to-paris-a-commitment-to-diversity-inspiration-and-community">The Olympics</a>, which “proudly accepts only Visa for card and mobile payments, along with cash”.</p>

<p>Bill Gates, commemorating Microsoft’s 50th anniversary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The story of how Microsoft came to be begins with, of
all things, a magazine. The January 1975 issue of
Popular Electronics featured an Altair 8800 on the
cover. The Altair 8800, created by a small electronics
company called MITS, was a groundbreaking personal
computer kit that promised to bring computing power to
hobbyists. When Paul and I saw that cover, we knew two
things: the PC revolution was imminent, and we wanted
to get in on the ground floor.</p>

<p>At the time, personal computers were practically non-existent.
Paul and I knew that creating software that let people program the
Altair could revolutionize the way people interacted with these
machines. So, we reached out to Ed Roberts, the founder of MITS,
and told him we had a version of the programming language BASIC
for the chip that the Altair 8800 ran on.</p>

<p>There was just one problem: We didn’t.<br/>
It was time to get to work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the bottom Gates links to a printout of the original source code for the BASIC interpreter, in extensively commented assembly language. Amongst all of his other accomplishments, Bill Gates was one hell of a programmer.</p>

<p>Wonderfully detailed write-up of a perfect prop from Make3:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Repurposed Nagra Knobs &amp; Switches — To ground the device in a
tangible, vintage aesthetic, we salvaged original knobs and
switches from a 1990s Nagra IV-D recorder, seamlessly integrating
them into our design. These components not only provided an
authentic look and feel but also remained fully functional, with:</p>

<ul>
<li>A power switch for system activation.</li>
<li>A reading on/off switch to engage or disable the Woe display.</li>
<li>A manual override switch to cycle through needle positions if
wireless control failed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>When I watched this episode, I remember noticing how cool the device seemed. It turns out to be even cooler than I thought. So much effort into such a little thing. And the coolest thing is that, in a sense, the WoeMeter actually <em>works</em> as a handheld wireless prop.</p>

<p>Reusing those Nagra dials to add verisimilitude reminds me of how much of <em>Star Wars</em> came from reused pieces of old gadgetry, like two of the lightsabers (Luke’s and Vader’s) <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-42369174">being made from 1940s-era Graflex camera flash guns</a>.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jason Snell, last month:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new M4 MacBook Air is the Mac most people should buy. [...]</p>

<p>That’s why perhaps the most important change in the M4 MacBook Air
is its base configuration, which starts at $999. When Apple
introduced a winning new flat-with-rounded-corners Air design in
2022, it had to keep selling older models in order to get down
under a thousand dollars. Three years later, Apple is finally able
to sell a brand-new Air — with a generous 16GB of unified memory — at that important price.</p>

<p>So: No more quibbles about stepping back a generation or two to an
older model with a lower price. Apple has done away with that
strategy for the MacBook Air: The latest and greatest model is the
one most people shopping for a Mac should buy, especially if
they’re coming from an Intel model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d put off linking to Snell’s review for a few weeks while thinking about writing my own, but I’ve got nothing to add. The M4 MacBook Air is utterly unsurprising, but only in the best possible way. It’s the MacBook Air everyone wanted Apple to make. The $999 base model is now exceedingly recommendable. It even brings back the most notable feature that was lost in the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon — the ability to drive two external displays <em>and</em> its own internal display. Just aces all around.</p>

<p>Following up on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/via-mastercard-apple-card">the previous item</a>, here’s a WSJ report from October on Visa’s dominant position in the payments industry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Visa, based in San Francisco, has built its network over more than
60 years — going back to clunky manual credit-card readers and
carbon-paper copies of receipts. It accounts for around 60% of the
total dollar amount of U.S. debit-card purchases and about 50% of
U.S. credit-card purchases, according to the Nilson Report, a
trade publication. Its closest competitor, Mastercard, accounts
for around 22% and 23%, respectively. Visa’s profit totaled $17.3
billion in its 2023 fiscal year, after more than tripling in the
last decade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amex accounts for about 19% of U.S. credit card transactions (and doesn’t support debit), and Discover is down around 3 or 4%. I really thought Visa and Mastercard had comparable market share, but it turns out Visa is far bigger, and it’s Mastercard and Amex that are around the same size.</p>

<p>AnnaMaria Andriotis, reporting for The Wall Street Journal (<a href="https://apple.news/AMIc70z-kQ4-ghz686tbG3Q">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Apple card is up for grabs because Goldman Sachs, the bank
behind it, is getting out of the consumer lending world. For
months, big banks including JPMorgan Chase and Synchrony Financial
have been vying to take over as issuer. What hasn’t been known is
the equally fierce fight playing out between the networks to win
Apple, with Visa and American Express trying to unseat Mastercard,
according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Apple is expected to select a network for the card before it picks
the bank to replace Goldman Sachs. Networks provide the plumbing
that transmit information between the banks that issue consumers’
cards and the merchants’ banks.</p>

<p>Visa, the largest network, has made an aggressive pitch to win the
card, including offering the kind of upfront payment to Apple
that’s normally reserved for the biggest card programs, the people
said. Visa offered a similar payment when Costco was selecting its
network about a decade ago, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p>

<p>American Express is also in the mix, trying to become both the
issuer and network of the Apple card, the people said. Goldman had
approached Amex to gauge its interest in taking over the card in
2023, the Journal earlier reported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve always thought Visa and Mastercard were interchangeable. I can’t recall ever once in my life seeing an establishment where one of them was accepted but the other wasn’t, and they both seem to be accepted everywhere that accepts credit cards at all. If there’s a reason to prefer one over the other I’ve never heard it.</p>

<p>Amex is different because it’s accepted at fewer locations because they charge merchants a higher fee, which they get away with because they offer their customers superior service. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/goldman-apple-card-losses">I wrote back in 2023</a> that they share an affinity with Apple: both are built around the idea of offering a premium experience and charging higher prices for it.</p>

<p>But I already have a regular Amex card. One of the things I like about Apple Card being a Mastercard (or if they switched to Visa) is that it’s a card I can use anywhere that doesn’t accept Amex.</p>

<p>Mike Masnick has a great piece at TechDirt running down just how <em>stupid</em> everything about Trump’s tariff trade war is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whoever on the Council of Economic Advisers used this formula should turn in their econ degree, because this is not how anything works. Even if they then go on to <a href="https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/reciprocal-tariff-calculations">publish another version</a> of the formula that looks all sophisticated and shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brendan Duke, on X, shows that the fancier version of their formula — which is fancy in the way that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/vertu-still-selling-phones">Vertu phones</a> are “fancy” — <a href="https://x.com/Brendan_Duke/status/1907741651172311353">is even stupider</a>, because the two Greek letters they chose to glam it up just cancel each other out.</p>

<p>Back to Masnick:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is what happens when you ask ChatGPT to “make my wrong econ
math look more scientific.” The document even admits that they
couldn’t figure out the actual tariff rates, so they “proxied”
them with this formula instead. That’s a bit like saying you
couldn’t find your house keys, so you proxied them with a banana.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem here isn’t just that the tariff numbers
are wrong — though they absolutely are. It’s that the entire
premise rests on treating trade deficits as if they were tariffs.
They’re not the same thing. At all.</p>

<p>Let’s back up for a moment and talk about trade deficits, because
Trump has been getting this wrong for longer than some of his
supporters have been alive. His logic appears to be:</p>

<ol>
<li>“Deficit” sounds bad</li>
<li>Therefore, trade deficits must be bad</li>
<li>Therefore, countries with whom we have trade deficits must be
cheating us</li>
<li>Therefore, we should punish them with tariffs to “level the
playing field”</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds like it must be an exaggeration for comic effect, but it’s not. That’s how Trump’s mind works. This is what Trump has been <em>saying</em> about trade deficits for decades. It’s like how he understands “asylum” to mean “insane asylum” and so when he talks about <em>political</em> asylum <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-hannibal-lecter-rant-origin.html">he starts talking about “the late great Hannibal Lecter”</a>.</p>

<p>The Economist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On economics Mr Trump’s assertions are flat-out nonsense. The
president says tariffs are needed to close America’s trade
deficit, which he sees as a transfer of wealth to foreigners. Yet
as any of the president’s economists could have told him, this
overall deficit arises because Americans choose to save less than
their country invests — and, crucially, this long-running reality
has not stopped its economy from outpacing the rest of the g7 for
over three decades. There is no reason why his extra tariffs
should eliminate the deficit. Insisting on balanced trade with
every trading partner individually is bonkers — like suggesting
that Texas would be richer if it insisted on balanced trade with
each of the other 49 states, or asking a company to ensure that
each of its suppliers is also a customer.</p>

<p>And Mr Trump’s grasp of the technicalities was pathetic. He
suggested that the new tariffs were based on an assessment of a
country’s tariffs against America, plus currency manipulation and
other supposed distortions, such as value-added tax. But it looks
as if officials set the tariffs using a formula that takes
America’s bilateral trade deficit as a share of goods imported
from each country and halves it — which is almost as random as
taxing you on the number of vowels in your name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no way to report on these tariffs in a way that is honest and accurate without describing them as bonkers and nonsensical. News publications that are trying to present them as rational, or describing them as “reciprocal” just because that’s the word the White House is using, <a href="https://presswatchers.org/2025/04/mainstream-media-falls-for-trumps-insane-reciprocal-tariff-talk/">are beclowning themselves</a>.</p>

<p>CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/02/stock-market-today-live-updates-trump-tariffs.html">Markets plunged</a> the day after President Donald Trump
imposed a far-reaching “reciprocal tariff” policy, including a
10% baseline tariff on almost every country on earth.</li>
<li>The plan slaps much steeper tariff rates on many countries,
including 34% on China, 20% on the European Union, 46% on
Vietnam and 32% on Taiwan.</li>
<li>Economists and U.S. trade partners <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/how-did-the-us-arrive-at-its-tariff-figures-.html">are raising
questions</a> about how the White House calculated the
tariff rates it claimed other countries “charge” the United
States.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple, in particular, is taking it on the chin, about 9.5% for the day. Amazon and Meta were both down 9%. Nike is down over 13%. From CNBC’s corresponding story on just <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/how-did-the-us-arrive-at-its-tariff-figures-.html">how the White House computed the “tariff” rates</a> it claims for various countries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many observers said the U.S. appeared to have divided the trade
deficit by imports from a given country to arrive at tariff rates
for individual countries.</p>

<p>Such methodology doesn’t necessarily align with the conventional
approach for calculating tariffs and implies the U.S. would have
looked at only the trade deficit in goods and ignored trade in
services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Such methodology doesn’t necessarily align with the conventional approach” is an overlong euphemism for “The president literally doesn’t understand what tariffs are.” James Surowiecki was seemingly <a href="https://x.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/1907559189234196942">the first person to figure out the White House’s nonsensical formula</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just figured out where these fake tariff rates come from. They
didn’t actually calculate tariff rates + non-tariff barriers, as
they say they did. Instead, for every country, they just took our
trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country’s
exports to us.</p>

<p>So we have a $17.9 billion trade deficit with Indonesia. Its
exports to us are $28 billion. $17.9/$28 = 64%, which Trump claims
is the tariff rate Indonesia charges us. What extraordinary
nonsense this is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don’t rack your brain trying to make sense out of the nonsensical.</p>

<p>Great roundup from The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Nintendo told us <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">very little in the official reveal of
the console in January</a>, now we know when the Switch 2 is
coming and how much it will cost at launch: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">June 5th and
$449.99</a>. We also have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630264/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-performance">more hardware details and specs to
pore over</a>, like a 1080p, 120Hz 7.9-inch LCD screen, Joy-Con
controllers with mouse-like functions, 256GB of storage, and 4K
output via the dock.</p>

<p>Nintendo also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">cleared up the mysteries about the system’s “C”
button</a> with details about new GameChat features and a camera
accessory and confirmed that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">GameCube games are coming to
Nintendo Switch Online,</a> along with a dedicated controller.</p>

<p>Last but not least, Nintendo showed off a number of new games,
like a Switch 2 edition of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> and the
exclusive Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People are going to object to the pricing, but the world has changed (and inflated) since the original Switch debuted in 2017. What I love about all of these announcements is that they’re so focused on <em>fun</em>. Nintendo doesn’t just still have it, they’ve got it more than they ever have.

<p>Stephen Battaglio, reporting for the LA Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MSNBC viewers have seen the last of Steve Kornacki’s big board.</p>

<p>The popular data maven has signed a deal with NBC that will expand
his presence across the network’s news and sports divisions. But
the new contract does not include working for MSNBC, which is
being spun off into a new corporate entity formed by parent
company Comcast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They might well just switch off the lights and lock the doors at MSNBC.</p>

<p>Watts Martin:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we hold things to this list, programs like Nova, MarsEdit, and
Apple Pages — canonical Mac-assed Mac apps — all do
unsurprisingly smashingly. But Obsidian, the Electron-based
program I’m writing in right now, does shockingly well, too.
Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code doesn’t do quite as well (most
notably, it opens its settings “window” as an editor tab), but it
does better than Sublime Text (which opens a text file for
settings), and much better than the banana crazypants menu and
icon design of the cross-platform e-book management program
Calibre.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Martin has a good list here of fundamentals, but ultimately, you know it when you see it.</p>

<p>Jason Snell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the ads played on, I began creating a thought experiment: There’s a $10 difference between the ad and ad-free plans. If Mr. Netflix (he wears a top hat) came to my house and said, “Jason, I’ve got a great deal for you. I’m going to pay you $120 a year, and all you have to do is watch ads while you watch Netflix,” what would I do? When I started thinking about it, I thought it might be an interesting intellectual question. What <em>would</em> I accept in exchange for having Mean Mr. Netflix beam ads into every show I watch?</p>

	<summary type="text">It’s like a consortium of sketchy pawn shops complaining to the authorities after a retailer successfully cracked down on an organized shoplifting/pickpocketing ring, and the authorities then fining the retailer for the damage to the pawnbrokers’ business fencing stolen goods — and for exposing the police as ineffective.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jon Brodkin, reporting for Ars Technica, “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/france-fines-apple-e150m-for-excessive-pop-ups-that-let-users-reject-tracking/">France Fines Apple €150M for “Excessive” Pop-Ups That Let Users Reject Tracking</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>France’s competition regulator fined Apple €150 million, saying
the iPhone maker went overboard in its implementation of pop-up
messages that let users consent to or reject tracking that
third-party applications use for targeted advertising.</p>

<p>The App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework used by Apple on
iPhones and iPads since 2021 makes the use of third-party
applications too complex and hurts small companies that rely on
advertising revenue, said a <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/targeted-advertising-autorite-de-la-concurrence-imposes-fine-eu150000000-apple">press release</a> today by the
Autorité de la concurrence (Competition Authority). The system
harms “smaller publishers in particular since, unlike the main
vertically integrated platforms, they depend to a large extent on
third-party data collection to finance their business,” the
agency said.</p>

<p>User consent obtained via the ATT framework “authorizes the
application in question to collect user data for targeted
advertising purposes,” the agency said. “If consent is given, the
application can access the Identifier for Advertisers (‘IDFA’),
the identifier by which each device can be tracked through its use
of third-party applications and sites.” The French investigation
was triggered by a complaint lodged by advertising industry
associations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ben Lovejoy, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/31/apple-bizarrely-fined-162m-for-app-tracking-transparency-after-advertisers-complained/">correctly calling the decision “bizarre” at 9to5Mac</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Complaints were made <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/11/apple-app-tracking/">in a number of countries</a> — some
arguing that it was unfair because <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/06/14/app-tracking-transparency-antitrust/">Apple exempts its own
apps</a> (which are in reality subject to even tighter
controls), others saying the loss of revenue <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/13/app-tracking-transparency-increases-in-app-purchase-prices/">forced developers to
raise prices</a> to compensate. [...]</p>

<p>Although expected, the decision is still inexplicable. ATT
involves precisely <em>one</em> popup asking a simple yes/no question.
Additionally, Apple lets users switch on a toggle (shown above) to
block apps from even asking the question. It’s especially odd
given that ATT is a privacy feature, and Europe has the strongest
privacy laws in the world. The EU <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/03/ad-tracking-rules/">has also previously
vindicated</a> Apple’s introduction of ATT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not inexplicable or odd if you view the decision as coming from a perspective where government bureaucracy is viewed as an inherent good, and well-intentioned process is all that matters, not actual results. Read the <em>Autorité de la Concurrence</em>’s decision (<a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/targeted-advertising-autorite-de-la-concurrence-imposes-fine-eu150000000-apple">which they helpfully do make available in English</a>) and it’s pretty clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>Autorité</em> found that the ATT framework imposed by Apple is
not necessary, insofar as the consent obtained is not valid under
the applicable laws, in particular the French Data Protection Act.</p>

<p>In practice, the fact that publishers that so wish cannot rely on
the ATT framework to comply with their legal obligations means
that they must continue to use their own consent collection
solutions, known as consent management platforms (“CMPs”). The
result is that multiple consent pop-ups are displayed, making the
use of third-party applications in the iOS environment excessively
complex, as observed by the French data protection authority
(<em>Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés</em> — CNIL)
in a 2022 opinion issued at the request of the <em>Autorité</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s ostensibly “not necessary” because French and EU privacy laws are supposedly enough, and all that’s needed. And it’s unfair because now, under ATT, third-party surveillance advertisers who seek to track users across apps on iOS need to ask permission twice — first through the clear-as-a-bell “Ask App Not to Track” / “Allow Tracking” prompt required by Apple, and again through the byzantine but ultimately toothless permission requirements of France and the EU. ATT has had measurable effects because users understand it, and they prefer not to be tracked. EU and French privacy laws are largely ineffective because, in practice, they <a href="https://hep.physics.illinois.edu/home/g-gollin/1984_commercial_dialogue.html">bury users with confusion</a>. The bureaucratic hurdles they impose are to the benefit, not detriment, of the surveillance ad industry. That’s now proven out by industry groups — the ones ATT successfully tempered — successfully getting France’s regulators to penalize Apple. <em>Users</em> don’t know how to lobby government bureaucracies. What the <em>Autorité de la Concurrence</em> is saying, in so many words, is that two layers of consent is too much, and the only one that’s necessary is the one that advertising lobbying groups <em>don’t object to</em>, not the one they do (but which users understand and like).</p>

<p>It’s clear that only one of these two things — Apple’s ATT or French/EU privacy regulations — was actually effective at reducing tracking: ATT. No one claimed that French or EU privacy laws resulted in Meta losing a fortune because they had to adjust their kleptomaniacal thievery of users’ privacy. But by all accounts, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2022/02/10/apple-meta-and-the-ten-billion-dollar-impact-of-privacy-changes/">including Meta’s own</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2022/04/23/apple-just-issued-stunning-12-billion-blow-to-facebook/">ATT cost Meta billions</a>. And yes, ATT hurt small businesses too — small businesses that were built upon surreptitious tracking that users had neither awareness of nor control over. It’s like a consortium of sketchy pawn shops complaining to the authorities after a popular retailer successfully cracked down on an organized shoplifting/pickpocketing ring, and the authorities then fining the retailer for the damage to the pawnbrokers’ business fencing stolen goods — and for exposing the police as ineffective.</p>

<p>App Tracking Transparency actually accomplished, in practice, via user-focused plain-language consent, what the EU’s privacy laws were intended to do but do not. This fine boils down to France declaring that Apple shouldn’t have actually done what the EU was pretending to do. They’re acting at the behest of the very developers and advertising companies who were (and still are) trying to conduct cross-app tracking that App Tracking Transparency successfully gave <em>users</em> some control over.</p>

<p>Brian Steinberg and Pat Saperstein, reporting for Variety over the weekend:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The White House Correspondents’ Association has canceled plans to
have comedian Amber Ruffin perform at its annual dinner on April
26, a new sign of the pressures being brought to bear on news
organizations during President Donald Trump’s second term.</p>

<p>The journalism group, which has seen its control over interactions
with Trump eroded in recent weeks, made the decision after Taylor
Budowich, a White House deputy chief of staff, raised comments
Ruffin has made in the past that are critical of Trump. Earlier
this week, Ruffin told a podcast backed by The Daily Beast that
she would not try to make sure her jokes targeted all sides of the
political spectrum as the WHCA had requested, and likened the
Trump administration to “kind of a bunch of murderers.” Playing to
both sides “makes them feel like human beings,” she said, “cause
they’re not.” [...]</p>

<p>“The WHCA board has unanimously decided we are no longer featuring
a comedic performance this year. At this consequential moment for
journalism, I want to ensure the focus is not on the politics of
division but entirely on awarding our colleagues for their
outstanding work and providing scholarship and mentorship to the
next generation of journalists,” WHCA president Eugene Daniels
wrote to members in a statement.</p>

<p>“For the past couple of weeks, I have been planning a
re-envisioning of our dinner tradition for this year,” he added.
“As the date nears, I will share more details of the plans in
place to honor journalistic excellence and a robust, independent
media covering the most powerful office in the world.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What an enormous mountain of obvious horseshit this explanation is. The WHCA only announced that Ruffin would be hosting this year’s show on February 4, at which point this lickspittle clown Eugene Daniels <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/amber-ruffin-2025-white-house-correspondents-dinner-1236126815/">was quoted thus by The Hollywood Reporter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I began to think about what entertainer would be a perfect
fit for the dinner this year, Amber was immediately at the top of
my list,” Eugene Daniels of Politico, president of the
association, said in a statement on Tuesday. “She has the ability
to walk the line between blistering commentary and humor all while
provoking her audience to think about the important issues of the
day. I’m thrilled and honored she said yes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So eight weeks ago this obsequious bootlicker Daniels thought Amber Ruffin “would be a perfect fit for the dinner this year” but now, four weeks before the show, he’s trying to claim with a straight face that “For the past couple of weeks, I have been planning a re-envisioning of our dinner tradition for this year”?</p>

<p>The kids magazine Highlights for Children has a long-running comic strip called “Goofus and Gallant”, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/06/goofus-and-gallant-american-parenting-highlights/674536/">the premise of which</a> is that Goofus is a kid who always does the wrong thing, and Gallant always does the right thing. Goofus, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/goofus-gallant-1948.jpg">especially in the older strips</a>, is an absurd parody. This Eugene Daniels toady is the Goofus of journalism. The entire point of the WHCA is to assert the group’s collective independence as journalists — and the independence they assert is specifically from the White House. So of course they shouldn’t have responded to White House pressure to fire Ruffin as this year’s host. But it’s even worse for an ostensible journalist — the president of the WHCA for chrissakes — to try to get even a single person in the world to believe that this is anything other than caving to White House pressure, and that in fact (“<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLRKhdQnd-k">Yeah, that’s the ticket!</a></em>”) he’d been planning to cancel the entire concept of having a comedian host at all “for the past couple of weeks” when just eight weeks ago he described Ruffin as “a perfect fit for the dinner this year”.</p>

<p>This is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/03/baghdad-bob-and-his-ridiculous-true-predictions/274241/">Baghdad Bob</a> level nonsense. I’m not one for performative resignations, but how does any news outlet or journalist agree to remain a member of the WHCA after this?</p>

<p>My thanks to Lex Friedman for sponsoring this past week at DF to promote Lex.Games, a collection of eight daily word games. Quoting from Friedman’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/03/lexgames_free_daily_word_games">own description in the sponsored RSS entry</a> at the start of the week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I paid Gruber many thousands of dollars to run this ad for free
games which themselves have no ads. Please keep reading.</p>

<p>The games:</p>

<p><em>Conlextions:</em> Inspired by NYT’s Connections<br/>
<em>Lexicogs:</em> Solve crossword-style clues by assembling letter “cogs”<br/>
<em>By a Vowel:</em> A word jumble game with missing vowels<br/>
<em>Six Appeal:</em> Wordle with six-letter words</p>

<p>There’s also a daily <em>Mini Crossword</em>; a <em>Full-Size Crossword</em>;
and <em>Mind Control</em>, which is a whole lot like Mastermind and not
actually a word game at all; don’t sue me.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you only counted seven games here, the eighth is
iOS-only. It’s called Letter Opener, and it’s my favorite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually hate Letter Opener, because I’m terrible at games like that. Looking at the leaderboard, though, obviously some of you are really good at it. Six Appeal is more my speed (which is to say, like Wordle, it has no clock). But go ahead and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lex-games-daily-word-games/id6498941705">download the iOS app and try Letter Opener</a>. Maybe you’re a fast enough thinker for it.</p>

<p>So the basic pitch is that Lex.Games really is just a bunch of fun daily games that are free to play, without ads (let alone without <em>annoying</em> ads). But you can — and should! — pay a modest $20/year to subscribe to get access to extra games, leaderboards, and just to support a very fun and satisfying endeavor.</p>

	<summary type="text">Perhaps Apple’s leadership simply believes, as I do, that cinema is the grandest and greatest form of art the world has ever seen — one that encompasses acting, writing, photography and/or illustration, and music — and but that great cinema is expensive and delicate and needs, from deep-pocketed studios and their deeper-pocketed corporate parents, more than patrons, but *champions*.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>With season 2 of <em>Severance</em> complete (with a remarkable bang), Apple TV+ has slid right into a new prestige series, <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/247767-the-studio?language=en-US">The Studio</a></em>, starring (and co-created by) Seth Rogen as the newly-appointed chief of the fictional and dysfunctional Continental Studios in Hollywood.</p>

<p>Two episodes in (out of 10 for the debut season), and it is fucking amazing. So far it feels a bit like a cross between <em>Entourage</em>, <em>The Larry Sanders Show</em>, <em>Boogie Nights</em>, and maybe a touch of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>. But the biggest influence and inspiration is clearly Robert Altman’s 1992 masterpiece <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/10403-the-player?language=en-US">The Player</a></em>, almost certainly the best Hollywood movie about Hollywood moviemaking that ever was or will be made.</p>

<p>What <em>The Studio</em> and <em>The Player</em> share is that they’re about the struggle to create great cinematic art within a corporate studio world run by unartistic know-it-all  self-important status-obsessed dullards driven by formula and fads — and, simultaneously, they are themselves almost unfathomably complicated and intricate works of cinematic art. They <em>are</em> what they’re <em>about</em>. They achieve what the characters within them fear is no longer achievable. When you get to episode 2 of <em>The Studio</em>, just keep asking yourself “Wait, <em>how</em> are they getting this shot?” The lighting, my god. The whole thing is just an outpouring of homage to <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/scanners/opening-shots-the-player">the opening shot of <em>The Player</em></a>, which of course itself calls back, <a href="https://filmotomy.com/quiet-on-the-set-breaking-down-the-opening-shot-in-altmans-the-player/">explicitly</a>, to Orson Welles’s <em>Touch of Evil</em>.</p>

<p><em>The Studio</em> is, thus far, engaging, surprising, funny, gorgeous, clever, and cinematically ambitious. It’s really quite a thing. I have no idea what’s coming in episodes 3–10, so maybe this piece will look a bit premature, if not foolish, in two months. But if the rest of season one is anything like the first two episodes, <em>The Studio</em> is a classic in the making.</p>

<p>The thought also occurs to me that this might be the don’t-over-think-it answer to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/apple-tv-spend-loss-or-cost">just what the hell Apple is doing making original shows and movies</a> in the first place. Perhaps Apple’s leadership simply believes, as I do, that cinema is the grandest and greatest form of art the world has ever seen — one that encompasses acting, writing, photography and/or illustration, and music — and but that great cinema is expensive and delicate and needs, from deep-pocketed studios and their deeper-pocketed corporate parents, more than patrons, but <em>champions</em>. And that in a media landscape where such champions of cinema-as-art and art-as-an-essential-public-good are fewer and fewer, it is Apple’s not just opportunity but <em>obligation</em> to step up to the plate.</p>

<p>I’ve long thought that one of the minor tragedies of Steve Jobs’s second act is that the timing just didn’t work out to sell Pixar to Apple, instead of to Disney. But make no mistake, a love and appreciation for great cinema is not outside Apple’s DNA. No streamer has a higher hit rate for quality shows. Their movies mostly stink so far, but maybe that’s just the learning curve. <em>The Gorge</em>, for example, feels like an Apple TV movie because it’s so decidedly meh. Not horrible, but not good in any way beyond its intriguing elevator-pitch concept. <em>Wolfs</em> was better but still a grand disappointment given its pedigree. But when it comes to shows, no one is doing better. <em>Severance</em> deserves all its acclaim and attention, and Ben Stiller delivered a season 2 finale that’s arguably the best 78 minutes of filmmaking I’ve seen this decade. And <em>The Studio</em>, to me, <em>feels</em> like an Apple TV show — not because of how it looks, what it’s about, or who’s in it, but simply because it’s so good. Netflix almost never makes shows like this. Neither does HBO now that’s its been subsumed by “Max”. Peacock et al don’t even try.<sup id="fnr1-2025-03-30"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-30">1</a></sup></p>

<p>One more A+ recommendation: <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/219971-the-agency">The Agency</a></em> on Paramount+. Michael Fassbender, Jeffrey Wright, Richard Gere, a breakout searing performance by Jodie Turner-Smith, and a great supporting cast in a super-smart, hyper-realistic-feeling spy-thriller/mystery/love story. Gorgeous cinematography too. Just so good in a “feels like it should have been on Apple TV+” way, sort of like how it was so obvious right from S1.E1 that HBO fucked up big-time by passing on <em>Mad Men</em>.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-03-30"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I really thought that the screen recording notifications in macOS
Sequoia would be the bane of my existence, but thankfully those
have been changed quite a bit from the early betas last summer and
they’re totally a non-issue in my book today. However, these god
damned “turn on reactions” alerts have got to die in a fire, and
they need to have done it yesterday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand why Apple decided to show this once. Why though, is it seemingly designed to reappear every time I start a video call? Who is <em>not</em> annoyed by this?</p>

<p>MG Siegler:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m not even talking about Apple and AI here. We’ve done that, <a href="https://spyglass.org/apple-ai-siri/">a
lot</a>. Probably enough — for now (famous last words). I’m
talking about Apple in general. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/2f3K43FHRKo?si=7lIWEBMSvCk-rxwG&amp;ref=spyglass.org">Watching this OpenAI video</a> — again, not an event, just a product walk-through with various
team members (though this one happened to be “MC’d” by Sam Altman) — I had this old, familiar feeling as they walked through the new
features: joy.</p>

<p>As ridiculous as it may sound, I was almost giddy around what I
was seeing. It’s a feeling that I recall well from many an Apple
event back in the day.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is <em>exactly</em> what I wanted! They did it!” That kind
of thing.</p>

<p>This will sound unfair or harsh to Apple, but I really don’t think
that it is. I can really only speak for myself here, and perhaps
I’m alone — but I suspect that I’m not — it has been a while
since I’ve gotten that feeling from an Apple announcement. That
loving feeling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I gave the updated ChatGPT the instruction “Create an image of the main characters from ‘Severance’ as Lego figures” and this is the first response it gave me:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/severance-chatgpt-4o.png" class="noborder">
  <img
    width = 425
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/severance-chatgpt-4o.png"
    alt = "Four Lego figures who look like Mark, Helly, Dylan (maybe?) and Irving (even less maybe)."
  /></a></p>

<p>I gave Apple’s Image Playground, running on MacOS 15.3.2 Sequoia, the equivalent prompt — “The main characters from ‘Severance’ as Lego figures” — and it gave me this as its first response:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/severance-image-playground.png" class="noborder">
  <img
    width = 425
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/severance-image-playground.png"
    alt = "Three Lego figures, two yellow, one red, which bear zero resemblance to anyone or anything from “Severance” whatsoever."
  /></a></p>

<p>One of the above images qualifies as “<em>Hey, that could be better but it’s pretty good for the first crack from a simple prompt</em>”, and the other qualifies as “<em>This bears zero resemblance to anyone or anything from</em> Severance”.</p>

<p>Guess which one of the two Apple is <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2025/1/7.html">actively promoting</a> to users as something they should try?</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>“Flagging” isn’t what I was writing about yesterday, with regard to Daring Fireball’s unexplained ghosting at Hacker News in recent years. If you look at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">the list of recent DF articles at HN</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43489058">only one is explicitly “flagged”</a>. Whoops, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43491009">now it’s two</a>, but they’re both the same article.</p>

<p><a href="https://cosocial.ca/@timbray/114232163652473173">Tim Bray</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m really glad <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber">@gruber</a> posted this, because me too. Same timeframe, same behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@reichenstein/114233318059789911">Oliver Reichenstein</a> (from <a href="https://ia.net/">iA</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Same for content from iA. Again and again our posts get to the top
page and then someone ghosts them. Ghosting started around the
same time as DF ghosting, I think. My take: It looks like someone
that has enough access just doesn’t like us. ¯\(ツ)/¯</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve heard privately from a few other bloggers that they’ve seen similar ghosting at HN in recent years.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html">Near the top of Hackers News’s FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>How are stories ranked?</em></p>

<p>The basic algorithm divides points by a power of the time since a
story was submitted. Comments in threads are ranked the same way.</p>

<p>Other factors affecting rank include user flags, anti-abuse
software, software which demotes overheated discussions, account
or site weighting, and moderator action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hacker News presents itself as a forum that is primarily driven by the community, where ranking and moderation are mostly, perhaps even overwhelmingly, transparent. And that “moderator action” is only a secondary or even tertiary factor. The core HN audience buys into this — the HN audience is comprised of people who view themselves as independent thinkers. Part of why they like and trust HN as an aggregator is that they believe they’re driving it, and that they know how the whole thing works.</p>

<p>My thesis is that the above <a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html">might once have been an accurate summary</a> of how Hacker News functioned, but hasn’t been for years, and that there now exists a cabal of moderator/admins with their thumbs on the scale, and their personal predilections are the primary steering force behind what’s permitted to surface and what gets ghosted. This moderation cabal operates more <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/posts?id=dang">or less</a> in secret. Their actions, and thus even their usernames, are invisible — lest the HN community discover that it’s steering things <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/maggie.gif">about as much as Maggie Simpson is</a>.</p>

<p>Read between the lines of the “<em>Hey, why</em> is <em>this post flagged?</em>” wonderment from genuinely openminded HN users <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43489058">in the comments on my now-flagged submission</a>, and you’ll catch a strong whiff of “Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!”</p>

	<summary type="text">What bothers me isn’t so much that Daring Fireball is shitlisted at Hacker News. What bothers me is that it’s unexplained.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Back in 2017, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/iphone_x_event_thoughts_and_observations">the iPhone X was announced alongside the iPhones 8 and 8 Plus</a> in mid-September. The iPhones 8 shipped that month, and I published <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/the_iphones_8">a review of the iPhones 8</a> on September 19. The iPhone X, though, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/the-future-is-here-iphone-x/">wasn’t available to order until October 27</a>, and didn’t start shipping to customers until November 3. It was an unusual iPhone release cycle that year, to say the least. Initial reviews of the much-anticipated iPhone X appeared on October 31, but I’d only had the phone for 24 hours when the embargo dropped, so I published <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/10/iphone_x_review_roundup">some initial impressions then</a>, but wound up not publishing my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/the_iphone_x">full review of the iPhone X</a> until December 26.</p>

<p>A few days later I wrote a follow-up regarding a specific new interaction design, “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/side_button_to_confirm_payments_on_iphone_x">Pressing the Side Button to Confirm Payments on iPhone X</a>”, which I began thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Occasionally I notice a burst of traffic to Daring Fireball from
Hacker News. It’s always short-lived, because for reasons I’ve
never seen explained, Daring Fireball articles always get
blacklisted from Hacker News once they hit their front page. It’s
apparent that a lot of HN readers do not like my work on the basis
that they see me as a shameless Apple shill, but it’s a shame the
articles get deleted because I like reading the comments. I feel
like it keeps me on my toes to read the comments from people who
don’t like Daring Fireball.</p>

<p>Even after being blacklisted from the Hacker News homepage,
though, the comment threads still exist. I went through <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16014464">the
Hacker News comments on my iPhone X review</a> today, and a few
comments about how Apple Pay works on the iPhone X caught my
attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I didn’t mention then was that DF’s buried status at HN was, at the time, a relatively new phenomenon. Hacker News <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/18/the-evolution-of-hacker-news/">started in early 2007</a> and for a yearslong stretch, Daring Fireball articles seemed more or less appropriately popular there. Articles that I would think would resonate with the HN readership would hit, and get what always seemed to me an appropriate number of comments. At some point in the mid-2010s though, it seemed like DF articles would get downvoted or flagged after hitting the HN front page. I’d been noticing this for some time when I wrote the above in December 2017.</p>

<p>But even in 2017, DF articles would get active comment threads on HN occasionally. The Hacker News thread I referenced above, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16014464">regarding my iPhone X review</a>, garnered 107 comments. In the years after that, DF articles went from being mysteriously disappeared <em>after</em> hitting the HN front page (and gaining some comment traction) to pretty much <em>never</em> hitting the HN front page (and thus never gaining any comment traction). I found this curious, and I couldn’t figure out <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html">why or how</a> this was happening — or who was doing it — but I didn’t mention it much.</p>

<p>Two years ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/making_our_hearts_sing#fn1-2023-02-01">I did mention it again in a footnote</a>, in a piece about the inexplicably poor state of Android apps from a design perspective:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It sounds a bit conspiratorial, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/side_button_to_confirm_payments_on_iphone_x">for several years
now</a> it’s seemed clear to me that Hacker News has
Daring Fireball in some sort of graylist. It’s not blacklisted,
obviously, given the aforementioned <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34605535">two</a>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34611552">threads</a> about yesterday’s piece, but nothing I
write here ever gains any significant traction there. Ever. And
the reason there are two threads for yesterday’s piece is that the
first one disappeared from the home page soon after it was posted.
I think? In <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">this list of recent Hacker News threads for articles
from DF</a>, going back four months, only three have
more than 10 comments — and two of those are the threads from
yesterday. I don’t know who I pissed off there or why, but I’ve
never seen an explanation for this. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626587">HN commenter
Michiel de Mare has quantified the apparent
suppression</a>, based on the ranking of this very
article. Exactly what I’ve noticed for years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see this yourself right now, with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">the current list of recent DF articles submitted to Hacker News</a>. Most of them have 0, 1, or 2 comments. Some got up to 3. “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino</a>” is the most read, most commented upon thing I’ve written in a while. On Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43348891">it got just 28 comments</a> before being shitlisted, which, I have to say, is just weird. That’s one piece I’d have thought would resonate with the HN audience, and make for good grist for discussion. Then, after the original thread was shitlisted, someone re-submitted it (perhaps confused that it wasn’t on the HN front page). That re-submission <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43355009">got 1 comment</a> before it too fell to the mysterious shitlist reaper.</p>

<p>The one recent exception is “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/why_cant_we_screenshot_frames_from_drm-protected_video">Why Can’t We Screenshot Frames From DRM-Protected Video on Apple Devices?</a>”, which somehow <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43223985">escaped the shitlist and garnered 208 comments</a>. These occasional exceptions to DF’s general shitlisting at HN have always made the whole thing more mysterious to me. There’s clearly no programmatic blacklisting that keeps Daring Fireball articles from being submitted, or from gaining a few comments. But once any traction occurs, <em>something</em> happens and poof, they’re gone from the Hacker News front page. It certainly doesn’t make any sense to me why my off-hand post griping about our inability to screenshot DRM video frames would be an order of magnitude more popular than “Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino” was.</p>

<p>Today, though, I saw <a href="https://jasette.facil.services/@jerome/114229390677476922">a helpful mention on Mastodon</a> that pointed me to an interesting project. An author named Michael Lynch has written a tool to quantify “<a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/">the highest-ranking personal blogs of Hacker News</a>” since HN’s inception in 2007. According to Lynch’s all-time listing, Daring Fireball ranks #5, which I have to say surprised me, given its years of inexplicable (or at the very least, unexplained) shitlisting status. But Lynch’s tool lets you select date ranges. If you look at <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2006-10-09&amp;end=2021-03-26&amp;limit=100">2007 through 2021</a>, Daring Fireball ranked #3, behind only <a href="https://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham’s renowned eponymous blog</a> and Brian Krebs’s excellent (and also eponymous) <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Krebs on Security</a>. From <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2006-10-09&amp;end=2013-03-26&amp;limit=100">2007 though 2013</a>, DF ranked #2, behind only Graham (who created Hacker News). But if you look at the last four years, from <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2021-10-09&amp;end=2025-03-26&amp;limit=100">2021 through 2025</a>, Daring Fireball ranks #72.</p>

<p>Maybe I’ve lost my fastball, and I just don’t write so good no more. Or maybe it’s not me, but the Hacker News audience that has changed in recent years.<sup id="fnr1-2025-03-26"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-26">1</a></sup> But it seems to me <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626587">there’s something fishy going on</a>. What bothers me isn’t so much that Daring Fireball is shitlisted at Hacker News — even though I really did enjoy reading the commentary on my posts back when they regularly surfaced there, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jgruber">still do</a> when one slips through the cracks. What bothers me is that it’s unexplained. Which, ultimately, seems not so much censorial as just cowardly.</p>

<p>Oliver Darcy, writing at Status (paywalled — great content, terrible CMS experience that keeps logging me out on all my devices and requires a stupid email magic link to get back in), in a brief interview with Atlantic editor-in-chief and man of the moment Jeffrey Goldberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It goes without saying that there are many ironies associated with
this particular story. One of them is that Goldberg, a journalist
who Donald Trump loathes for his past reporting (remember the
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/">“suckers and losers” piece</a>), somehow became the unintended
recipient of high-level, real-time military intelligence from
inside his own inner circle. One wonders whether any heads will
roll as a result of the whole matter. On Monday, Trump again made
his disdain for Goldberg known, blasting him at a press conference
and absurdly claiming The Atlantic is “a magazine that is going
out of business.”</p>

<p>If anything, of course, publishing a story like the one Goldberg
did on Monday proves how strong the outlet currently is. That type
of muscular journalism requires skill, strong leadership, and the
backing of a courageous publisher. I asked Goldberg about owner
Laurene Powell Jobs’ role in the matter. He declined to comment
specifically on this particular story, but offered words of
praise: “Laurene Powell Jobs is a stalwart and brave publisher at
a time when cowardice rules the day.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it had been a Washington Post reporter who was inadvertently included on the Trump national security team’s Signal group chat, would they have run the story? No fucking way with that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/journalism_requires_owners_committed_to_the_cause">abject lickspittle coward Jeff Bezos</a> running the show.</p>

<p>Hartley Charlton, MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s next-generation CarPlay experience is still nowhere to be
seen following <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2025/products/porsche-communication-management-change-of-the-model-year-38985.html">Porsche’s announcement</a> of a major upgrade of
its infotainment system for 2026.</p>

<p>The upcoming 2026 model year Porsche Taycan, 911, Panamera, and
Cayenne feature an upgraded version of the Porsche Communication
Management (PCM) system, making it more responsive, adding Dolby
Atmos support, and integrating Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant. The
new system brings the Porsche App Center, a kind of app store for
the vehicle, to all of the new models.</p>

<p>It continues to support the standard version of Apple CarPlay and
Android Auto. Support for Apple’s next-generation CarPlay
experience is again conspicuously missing from Porsche’s new
lineup, and the automaker did not mention it at all during its
latest announcement — another bleak sign for the delayed feature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d crack a joke about it looking less and less likely that next-gen CarPlay was going to appear in 2024, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/apple-carplay-2024">I already did that in January</a>, when Apple itself took the date off <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">its CarPlay page</a>. That announcement <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-carplay-could-revolutionize-your-cars-interface-in-2023">came at WWDC 2022</a>.</p>

<p>In this case (unlike the advanced personalized features of Apple Intelligence) it was actually sensible for Apple to pre-announce the existence of next-gen CarPlay, given the reliance on third parties. But it also should have been clear just how incredibly hard it would be to get third party carmakers up to snuff on being able to ship it, so Apple giving a date, any date, was always odd. Apple doesn’t make a car, and you can’t promise what you can’t control. They should have just said “soon”.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jeffrey Goldberg and Shane Harris, reporting once again for The Atlantic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ratcliffe said much the same: “My communications, to be clear, in
the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and
did not include classified information.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/tag/person/donald-trump/">President Donald Trump</a>, asked yesterday afternoon about the
same matter, said, “It wasn’t classified information.”</p>

<p>These statements presented us with a dilemma. In The Atlantic’s
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">initial story about the Signal chat</a> — the “Houthi PC small
group,” as it was named by Waltz — we withheld specific
information related to weapons and to the timing of attacks that
we found in certain texts. As a general rule, we do not publish
information about military operations if that information could
possibly jeopardize the lives of U.S. personnel. That is why we
chose to characterize the nature of the information being shared,
not specific details about the attacks.</p>

<p>The statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump — combined with the assertions made by numerous administration
officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts — have led us to believe that people should see the texts in
order to reach their own conclusions. There is a clear public
interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers
included in nonsecure communications channels, especially because
senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the
significance of the messages that were shared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/25/trump-has-surrounded-himself-with-idiots">I linked yesterday</a> to a quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt">Hannah Arendt</a>, whom Wikipedia aptly describes as “one of the most influential political theorists of the twentieth century”. The quote I linked to was her observation that the ranks of authoritarian governments inevitably wind up being filled with “crackpots and fools” because they’re  the people whose loyalty is most assured. In some sense the Jedi mind trick is real — it works on the weak-minded. Regardless of one’s political beliefs, no intelligent person of integrity (as opposed to, say, a foreign mole) would participate in a discussion of obviously classified and highly sensitive war plans in a Signal chat. It’s jarring to see it so clearly but U.S. national security is now led entirely by morons.</p>

<p>Most of the quotes on the Goodreads page I linked to, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/23497-the-origins-of-totalitarianism">culled from Arendt’s seminal <em>The Origins of Totalitarianism</em></a>, are related to truth, not idiocy. Here’s one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The outstanding negative quality of the totalitarian elite is that
it never stops to think about the world as it really is and never
compares the lies with reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before mass leaders seize the power to fit reality to their lies,
their propaganda is marked by its extreme contempt for facts as
such, for in their opinion fact depends entirely on the power of
man who can fabricate it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi
or the convinced Communist, but people for whom the distinction
between fact and fiction (i.e., the reality of experience) and the
distinction between true and false (i.e., the standards of
thought) no longer exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When The Atlantic’s initial story hit, everyone responsible in the Trump administration, right up to the president himself, just immediately began telling bald-faced lies about what happened, despite the fact that they <em>knew</em> Jeffrey Goldberg literally had the receipts to prove otherwise. That works, until it doesn’t.</p>

	<summary type="text">Bluesky is what Twitter of yore aspired to be.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Yours truly back in May 2023, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110314382066961654">in a thread on Mastodon</a> (at the time, you needed an invitation code to get into Bluesky, and it was just a few months after Musk’s takeover and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/tweetbot_and_twitterrific_face_the_cliff">remaking of what was once Twitter</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bluesky is going to skyrocket to mainstream popularity and
actually replace Twitter, and Mastodon cannot, because Bluesky is
being designed to be simple, fun, and — most importantly — easy
to understand.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to provoke. I like Mastodon, especially using
<a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a>, and I love the community I’m in here. And maybe our
community will stay here. What makes Mastodon good for us nerds is
that all the non-nerds aren’t here.</p>

<p>But it’s obvious already: regular people instantly grok Bluesky.
They’ve had months to sign up for Mastodon and haven’t — because
they don’t understand it, and what they see of it doesn’t look
like fun.</p>

<p>As soon as they see Bluesky they start trying to score an
invite code.</p>

<p>Bluesky, in both word (stated intentions) and deed (the nascent
service as it stands today), aspires to be a better Twitter. An
idealized Twitter, perhaps. It even looks just like Twitter — without all the crap.</p>

<p>Mastodon was created by and for people who wanted something
different from Twitter. So when Twitter refugees show up, it
doesn’t feel familiar. Because it’s not supposed to. [...]
Hundreds of millions of people liked what Twitter once was, and
what it aspired to be. Bluesky might be that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As recently as last September, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/03/brazil-x-bluesky">that prediction wasn’t looking so good</a>. But Bluesky finally got some traction around (and especially after) the election, and the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bluesky+has+the+juice">juice</a> it picked up wasn’t fleeting.</p>

<p>This isn’t a diss on Mastodon. If I could only use one of these platforms, Mastodon would be it. By far the highest signal-to-noise ratio amongst my timelines, and by far the best engagement with my readers and listeners. It’s a nerdy platform for nerdy users, but with its commitment to true openness, including APIs, it’s also the platform with by far the best <em>and most varied</em> client apps.</p>

<p>In the old world, there was one Twitter-like network that mattered: Twitter itself. In the new world, there exists a diaspora of refugees across these Twitter-like platforms, which have each carved out their own vibes. There are pros and cons to the old world and new. I found it much easier, mentally, to have just one place to check, and that place was available through <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/tweetbot_and_twitterrific_face_the_cliff">truly excellent native apps</a> for both Mac and iOS. Now that my attention is spread across multiple such networks — (in order of attention) Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, and, last and definitely least, but still there, X — I feel more scattered mentally, but I’m also pretty sure I spend less time overall using all of them combined today than I did for Twitter’s peak decade-or-so, and that I’m better off for that.</p>

<p>It helps, too, that the first-party apps for Bluesky and Threads are mediocre on iOS (and Threads, oddly, is quite slow everywhere) and can only be used via the web on the Mac — they don’t even have bad Mac client apps, they have <em>no</em> Mac client apps. <em>Helps</em> that is, insofar as I therefore spend less time using them. I’m greatly looking forward to Tapbots’s upcoming Bluesky client, <a href="https://tapbots.com/phoenix/">Phoenix</a>, but in the back of my mind I’m vaguely worried that Phoenix might ultimately make me less productive because the additional joy and efficiency it will add to my Bluesky experience will lead me to spend more time there than I should. A good problem to have.</p>

<p>What I didn’t see coming in May 2023 was Meta’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/threads">successful launch of Threads that summer</a>. The core problem with Threads is that I don’t think there’s a true vision behind it, other than serving to fuck with Elon Musk and X. It’s always been kind of interesting and kind of fun, and has never been toxic. (Meta’s much-ballyhooed “<em>there’s a new sheriff in town and we aim to please him</em>” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/meta_zuck_content_moderation_zig_zag">content-moderation policy changes in January</a> have seemingly had no effect whatsoever on the tenor or activity on Threads.) But it’s never been <em>really</em> interesting or <em>really</em> fun. It’s a platform without a soul. It aspires to be anodyne, which is very different than empowering users not to feel like they’ve got to dodge a never-ending barrage of turds being thrown by the angry chaos monkeys who’ve overrun X. If Threads does have a vibe, that vibe is blandness.</p>

<p>But so while Threads bursting onto the scene in summer 2023 maybe delayed Bluesky’s blossoming, I suspect Threads might have ultimately <em>helped</em> Bluesky by opening the minds of many Twitter refugees into just <em>trying</em> some new alternatives. One size doesn’t fit all. Nor one social network.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that I think my May 2023 prediction is proving out. Bluesky is what Twitter of yore aspired to be. Users are in control of what they see in their timelines. Sub-communities are vibrant. Shitbirds get blocked and added to blocklists, not elevated to the top of reply threads because they paid for a blue-check power-up. The centralized nature of the Bluesky platform gives the hardcore federation zealots the heebie-jeebies, but that’s what makes Bluesky understandable and approachable, and I think clearly more performant than Mastodon can ever hope to be. It’s a really cool concept for a Twitter-like platform that, after a slow build-up, has turned into an actual really cool platform, whose focus, first and foremost, is putting users first.</p>

<p>Lex.Games is an iOS app (and website) for playing eight daily word games.</p>

<p>I paid Gruber many thousands of dollars to run this ad for free games which themselves have no ads. Please keep reading. </p>

<p>The games:</p>

<p><em>Conlextions:</em> Inspired by NYT’s Connections<br/>
<em>Lexicogs:</em> Solve crossword-style clues by assembling letter “cogs”<br/>
<em>By a Vowel:</em> A word jumble game with missing vowels<br/>
<em>Six Appeal:</em> Wordle with six-letter words</p>

<p>There’s also a daily <em>Mini Crossword</em>; a <em>Full-Size Crossword</em>; and <em>Mind Control</em>, which is a whole lot like Mastermind and not actually a word game at all; don’t sue me.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you only counted seven games here, the eighth is iOS-only. It’s called Letter Opener, and it’s my favorite.</p>

<p>My number one tip for becoming a Mac power user is to get into <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a>. Using Keyboard Maestro feels like gaining superpowers. I keep meaning to write more about Keyboard Maestro, and so I’m just going to start documenting all the little use cases I find for it. Here’s one from today.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> to publish at least 99 percent of the posts on this site. (The other 1 percent are posts I create on my phone, using the web interface for Movable Type.) I use MarsEdit <em>a lot</em>. About once a week or so, I accidentally try to paste text in MarsEdit when I think I have text on my clipboard, but it’s actually an image. When you paste an image in MarsEdit, it’s not like pasting into Mail or Notes or TextEdit, where the image just goes into the text. So MarsEdit, trying to be helpful, opens its <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/marsedit-upload-utility.png">Upload Utility window</a> — which, if I were using WordPress or some other CMS, might allow me to upload the image to my server for referencing from the HTML of the blog post. That’s not how my system works, and not how I want it to work, so every time this happens I have to close the Upload Utility window. And every time, I try to do this by hitting the Esc key on my keyboard. But the Upload Utility window isn’t a dialog box with a Cancel button that would be triggered by Esc. It’s a regular window. So after hitting the Esc key, which doesn’t do anything in this context, I then remember, once again, that I need to hit ⌘W instead. (I think I don’t naturally think to hit ⌘W because my instincts tell me ⌘W would try to close the blog window I’m writing in.)</p>

<p>Today it happened again, and finally the notion occurred to me that I could fix this with Keyboard Maestro. My first thought was that I could create a macro that <em>would</em> close the frontmost window in MarsEdit if, and only if, the frontmost window was named “Upload Utility”. A second later it occurred to me that I could probably do better than that, and prevent the Upload Utility window from opening in the first place if I ever try to paste an image in MarsEdit.</p>

<p>I was right. This wasn’t just super easy to create in Keyboard Maestro, it was super quick. I’ve spent 10× more time writing about this macro here than I did creating it. I think that’s why I so seldom write about my little hacks in Keyboard Maestro — they not only save me time and eliminate annoyances once they’re created, but they’re so easy to create that I just get back to whatever I was previously doing after making a new one.</p>

<p>First, I have a group (think: folders) in Keyboard Maestro for every app for which I’ve created app-specific macros. You just create a new group and set it to only be available when one (or more) specific applications are active. Inside my group for MarsEdit, I created a new macro named “Don’t Paste Images”.</p>

<p>It’s triggered by the hot key sequence ⌘V. That means every single time I paste in MarsEdit, this macro will run. Keyboard Maestro is so frigging fast that I’ll never notice. (Keyboard Maestro macros execute so fast that in some scenarios, you have to add steps to pause for, say, 0.2 seconds to keep the macro from getting ahead of the user interface it’s manipulating.)</p>

<p>The macro executes a simple <a href="https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/action/If_Then_Else">if-then-else action</a> with the following pseudocode logic:</p>

<pre><code>if the System Clipboard has an image
    play a sound
else
    simulate the keystroke ⌘V
</code></pre>

<p>That’s the whole thing. And it worked perfectly the first time I tried it. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/km-dont-paste-images-marsedit.png">Here’s a screenshot of my macro</a>.</p>

<p>So if <em>I</em> type ⌘V in MarsEdit, and the clipboard contains an image, I just hear a beep. (I could just default to the system beep, but I chose the standard MacOS “Bottle” sound just for this macro — I sort of want to know that it’s <em>this</em> macro keeping me from pasting whatever text I wrongly thought was on my clipboard, so I want a distinctive sound to play.) Nothing gets pasted, so MarsEdit’s Upload Utility window doesn’t appear.</p>

<p>If the clipboard <em>doesn’t</em> contain an image, then Keyboard Maestro simulates a ⌘V shortcut and that gets passed to MarsEdit, and from my perspective as a user, it’s just like a normal paste of the text I expected. I have a few macros that work like this, where the macro is trigged by an application’s own keyboard shortcut, and the macro will (if certain conditions are met) pass through the same simulated keyboard shortcut to the application. When I first tried this, many years ago, I was half worried that it would trigger an infinite loop, where the simulated keystroke from the Keyboard Maestro macro would re-trigger the macro. I was wrong to worry — Keyboard Maestro is too clever for that.</p>

<p>You almost certainly don’t have my particular problem with the occasional inadvertent pasting of images into MarsEdit. But I bet you have your own esoteric annoyances related to your own most-used apps and most-frequent tasks. Keyboard Maestro lets you effectively add your own little features to your favorite apps — often with no “scripting” at all. The best part is, while writing this very blog post, my new “Don’t Paste Images” macro saved me from seeing that cursed Upload Utility window once more, because I had the screenshot of the macro on my clipboard, when I thought I had copied the URL for it on my server.</p>

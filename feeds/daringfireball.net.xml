<p>Filipe Espósito, in a scoop for 9to5Mac all the way back in October:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>9to5Mac has learned details about the new project from reliable
sources familiar with the matter. The new app combines
functionality from the App Store and Game Center in one place. The
gaming app is not expected to replace Game Center. In fact, it
will integrate with the user’s Game Center profile.</p>

<p>According to our sources, the app will have multiple tabs,
including a “Play Now” tab, a tab for the user’s games, friends,
and more. In Play Now, users will find editorial content and game
suggestions. The app will also show things like challenges,
leaderboards, and achievements. Games from both the App Store and
Apple Arcade will be featured in the new store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even before <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/27/ios-19-gaming-app/">Mark Gurman corroborated this report</a> last week, I’ve had a spitball theory about what it might mean. Perhaps this is about more than having one app (Games) for finding and installing games, and another (App Store) for finding and installing apps. It could signal that Apple is poised to establish different policies for apps and games. Like, what if games still use the longstanding 70/30 commission split (with small business developers getting 85/15), but non-game apps get a new reduced rate? Say, 80/20 or even 85/15 right off the top, with small business developers and second-year subscriptions going to 90/10?</p>

<p>Having separate store apps for apps and games would help establish the idea that games and apps are two entirely different markets. Thus: two different stores?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://spyglass.org/apple-gaming-app-store/">MG Siegler offered the same spitball</a> — back on May 28. Great minds think alike.</p>

<p>Scharon Harding, writing at Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Just disconnect your TV from the Internet and use an Apple
TV box.”</p>

<p>That’s the common guidance you’ll hear from Ars readers for those
seeking the joys of streaming without giving up too much privacy.
Based on our research and the experts we’ve consulted, that advice
is pretty solid, as Apple TVs offer significantly more privacy
than other streaming hardware providers.</p>

<p>But how private are Apple TV boxes, really? Apple TVs don’t use
automatic content recognition (ACR, a user-tracking technology
leveraged by nearly all smart TVs and streaming devices), but
could that change? And what about the software that Apple TV users
do use — could those apps provide information about you to
advertisers or Apple?</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll delve into what makes the Apple TV’s
privacy stand out and examine whether users should expect the
limited ads and enhanced privacy to last forever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>tvOS is perhaps Apple’s least-talked-about platform. (It surely has orders of magnitude more users than VisionOS, but VisionOS gets talked about because it’s so audacious.) But it might be their platform that’s the furthest ahead of its competition. Not because tvOS is insanely great, but it’s at least pretty good, and every other streaming TV platform seems to be in a race to make real <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqQ6D0Bu-a8">the future TV interface from <em>Idiocracy</em></a>. It’s not just that they’re bad interfaces with deplorable privacy, it’s that they’re outright <em>against</em> the user.</p>

<p>Parshin Shojaee, Iman Mirzadeh, Keivan Alizadeh, Maxwell Horton, Samy Bengio, and Mehrdad Farajtabar, from Apple’s Machine Learning Research team:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recent generations of frontier language models have introduced
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that generate detailed thinking
processes before providing answers. While these models demonstrate
improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental
capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain
insufficiently understood. [...] Through extensive experimentation
across diverse puzzles, we show that frontier LRMs face a complete
accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they
exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort
increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines
despite having an adequate token budget. By comparing LRMs with
their standard LLM counterparts under equivalent inference
compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-complexity
tasks where standard models surprisingly outperform LRMs, (2)
medium-complexity tasks where additional thinking in LRMs
demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both
models experience complete collapse. We found that LRMs have
limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit
algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles. We also
investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the
patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models’
computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths,
limitations, and ultimately raising crucial questions about their
true reasoning capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The full paper is quite readable, but today was my travel day and I haven’t had time to dig in. And <a href="https://ml-site.cdn-apple.com/papers/the-illusion-of-thinking.pdf">it’s a PDF</a> so I couldn’t read it on my phone. (Coincidence or not that this dropped on the eve of WWDC?)</p>

<p>My basic understanding after a skim is that the paper shows, or at least strongly suggests, that LRMs don’t “reason” at all. They just use vastly more complex pattern-matching than LLMs. The result is that LRMs effectively overthink on simple problems, outperform LLMs on mid-complexity puzzles, and fail in the same exact way LLMs do on high-complexity tasks and puzzles.</p>

	<summary type="text">If it takes Apple as long to have its own competitive LLMs as it did to have its own competitive web browser, I suspect they’ll soon be paying to use the LLMs that are owned and controlled by others, not charging the others for the privilege of reaching Apple’s platform users.</summary>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-06-08/apple-s-liquid-glass-ios-26-software-redesign-to-hint-at-20th-anniversary-iphone-mbnm2u0d?cmpid=BBD060825_POWERON">Mark Gurman, in his eve-of-WWDC Power On column at Bloomberg</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Liquid Glass interface is going to be the most exciting part
of this year’s developer conference. It will also be a bit of a
distraction from the reality facing Apple: The company is behind
in artificial intelligence, and WWDC will do little to change
that. Instead, Apple is making its successful operating system
franchise more capable and sleek — even as others move on to more
groundbreaking AI-centric interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the first major hint that Apple was moving toward fluidity in the UI was the Dynamic Island, which doesn’t merely expand and contract as it changes shape, but rather appears to <em>flow</em>, <a href="https://www.lux.camera/physicality-the-new-age-of-ui/#:~:text=The%20Dynamic%20Island%20is%20a%20stark%2C%20graphic%20interface%20that%20behaves%20like%20an%20interactive%2C%20viscous%20liquid">with a pleasant viscosity</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best analogy for Apple right now might be the car industry.
Apple produces the best gas cars on the road (its operating
systems) and is making them even more upscale. It has rolled out a
hybrid (Apple Intelligence), but it’s <a href="https://archive.ph/o/AKlk9/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong">struggling to make</a> a
true all-electric vehicle (unlike companies such as OpenAI and
Alphabet Inc.’s Google).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is such a terrible analogy. If you buy an EV, you use it <em>instead of</em> your old gas-powered car. There’s nothing from OpenAI or Google that allows you to not use a conventional device — phone, tablet, or PC. The only way to use ChatGPT, or Gemini, or <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/veo/">Google’s rather amazing Veo 3</a> video generation tool, is using a phone or computer running iOS, MacOS, Android, Windows, or Linux. Gurman’s analogy would only work if the way you got around in an EV was to put it in the back of a gas-powered flatbed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfJ3QxJYsw8">truck</a>.</p>

<p>Gas-powered vehicles are probably going away. I sure hope they do. But cars and trucks aren’t going away. A better analogy is that AI is doing to today’s dominant OSes what web browsers did to Windows in the late 1990s. They’re adding new interactive layers atop the old. Windows didn’t go away. Microsoft still makes tons of money from Windows today. But Windows’s primacy as a platform went away. And: Microsoft pivoted quickly in the face of Netscape and the web’s threat, and created Internet Explorer, which squashed Netscape, and became, for at least a decade, the preeminent web browser. It was essential for Apple to create Safari/WebKit for Mac OS X to thrive. If Apple hadn’t succeeded with WebKit on Mac OS X they wouldn’t have had their own first-class web rendering engine to adapt for a 3.5-inch touchscreen in 2007. The iPhone without the real web wouldn’t have been the iPhone. And the only reason the original iPhone had the real web is that Apple owned and controlled Safari and WebKit.</p>

<p>What Apple, I think, needs for iOS and MacOS is the AI equivalent of what Safari and WebKit were for the web two decades ago. The <a href="https://www.asymco.com/2011/01/17/the-cook-doctrine/">oft-cited Cook Doctrine</a> says “we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products we make.” 25 years ago it was obvious that web browsers and rendering engines were primary technologies. Apple certainly couldn’t afford back then to continue to be dependent upon Microsoft for the Mac version of IE, nor on open source cross-platform browsers like Firefox that would never feel native on the Mac (or, more importantly, on future Apple platforms). But Safari and WebKit were, if you think about it, late. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2003/01/safari">They were announced at Macworld Expo in January 2003</a> (just five months after the debut of this website). Netscape’s blockbuster IPO was in August 1995, over seven years prior. The entire dot-com bubble and bust took place before Safari shipped. The Mac, and thus Apple, made do with non-Apple browsers in those intervening years — browsers that were all some mix of non-native clunky UI, slow, incompatible (with Windows IE), ugly (e.g. IE text rendering on Mac OS X), and often downright unstable. (And application crashes on classic Mac OS would often bring down the entire system.)</p>

<p>The concern for Apple today is that they’re in trouble if it takes six or seven years for them to get to their Safari/WebKit moment for AI. Things are moving faster with AI today than they were with the web in the 1990s. At the peak of Netscape mania in 1995, there were many who believed Netscape would topple Microsoft. At the time Netscape founder Marc Andreessen <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">proclaimed</a> that Netscape would reduce Windows to “a poorly debugged set of device drivers.” That obviously didn’t happen. But perhaps not just <em>a</em> but <em>the</em> reason why that didn’t happen is that Microsoft quickly built and shipped a better browser than Netscape’s. They didn’t just build a browser into Windows, they built a <em>better</em> browser into Windows. And they made a better browser for the Mac too. If it had taken Microsoft until 2003 (when Apple debuted Safari) to ship IE, computing platform history may well be very different.</p>

<p>iOS today is the closest to what Windows was circa 1995. iOS doesn’t have Windows’s 95 percent market share, but the iPhone has some sort of monopoly <em>profit</em> share in mobile device sales. And iOS is plainly dominant. That’s why there’s all this <em>Sturm und Drang</em> surrounding Apple’s App Store commissions and iron-fisted control over all iOS software. After the announcement last year of OpenAI as a partner for “world knowledge” in Apple Intelligence — and, a year later, they’re still the only partner — Wayne Ma at The Information reported that Apple wasn’t paying a cent for this integration, and that the plan <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/13/ma-apple-openai">was for OpenAI to eventually begin paying Apple in a revenue sharing deal</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Neither Apple nor OpenAI are paying each other to integrate
ChatGPT into the iPhone, according to a person with knowledge of
the deal. Instead, OpenAI hopes greater exposure on iPhones will
help it sell a paid version of ChatGPT, which costs around $20 a
month for individuals. Apple would take its 30% cut of these
subscriptions as is customary for in-app purchases.</p>

<p>Sometime in the future, Apple hopes to strike revenue-sharing
agreements with AI partners in which it gets a cut of the revenue
generated from integrating their chatbots with the iPhone,
according to Bloomberg, which first reported details of the deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds a lot like the revenue sharing deal Apple has with Google for search in Safari — a deal (which is at some degree of risk <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/07/eddy-cue-safari-ai">from Google’s own antitrust problems</a>) that now results in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/google-aggregate-search-default">Google paying Apple over $20 billion per year</a> for the traffic Safari sends to Google Search.</p>

<p>In hindsight, we now know that web browsers, in and of themselves, don’t generate any money directly. Someone was going to give a good one away free and now almost all of them are free of charge. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t essential for a platform to own and control its own browser. Web search, it turns out, is where the money is on the World Wide Web. Not just <em>some</em> money but an almost unfathomable amount of money. Web search is not primary technology for Apple’s platforms. But because they own and control Safari and WebKit, and Safari and WebKit are <em>very good</em> (so that most of Apple’s customers use them), Apple is in a position to profit very handsomely from web search, even though it doesn’t even have a search engine to speak of. Apple’s net annual profit the last few years has been around $95 billion. If we assume Google’s $20B/year traffic acquisition revenue sharing payments to Apple are mostly profit, that means somewhere between 20–25 percent of all Apple’s profit comes from that deal.</p>

<p>So are LLMs more like browsers (platforms need to own and control their own, but they won’t make money from them directly) or like web search (dominant platforms like Apple’s don’t need their own, but Apple can profit handsomely by charging for integration with their platforms)?</p>

<p>I think the answer is somewhere in between. Browsers are essential to personal computing platforms because they run on-device. Web search isn’t essential to own and control because it runs in the cloud, but exists only to serve users running devices. LLMs run both locally and in the cloud. If it takes Apple as long to have its own competitive LLMs as it did to have its own competitive web browser, I suspect they’ll soon be paying to use the LLMs that are owned and controlled by others, not charging the others for the privilege of reaching Apple’s platform users. No simple analogy captures this dynamic. But the threat is palpable.</p>

<p>I will say, though, “Liquid Glass” sounds cool.</p>

<p>From his family, on Atkinson’s Facebook page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We regret to write that our beloved husband, father, and
stepfather Bill Atkinson passed away on the night of Thursday,
June 5th, 2025, due to pancreatic cancer. He was at home in
Portola Valley in his bed, surrounded by family. We will miss him
greatly, and he will be missed by many of you, too. He was a
remarkable person, and the world will be forever different because
he lived in it. He was fascinated by consciousness, and as he has
passed on to a different level of consciousness, we wish him a
journey as meaningful as the one it has been to have him in our
lives. He is survived by his wife, two daughters, stepson,
stepdaughter, two brothers, four sisters, and dog, Poppy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the great heroes in not just Apple history, but computer history. If you want to cheer yourself up, go to Andy Hertzfeld’s Folklore.org site and (re-)read all the entries about Atkinson. Here’s just one, with <a href="https://folklore.org/Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.html">Steve Jobs inspiring Atkinson to invent the roundrect</a>. Here’s another (surely near and dear to my friend <a href="https://inessential.com/2002/06/25/deleting_code.html">Brent Simmons’s heart</a>) with <a href="https://www.folklore.org/Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.html">this kicker of a closing line</a>: “I’m not sure how the managers reacted to that, but I do know that after a couple more weeks, they stopped asking Bill to fill out the form, and he gladly complied.”</p>

<p>Some of his code and algorithms are among the most efficient and elegant ever devised. The original Macintosh team was chock full of geniuses, but Atkinson might have been the most essential to making the impossible possible under the extraordinary technical limitations of that hardware. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bill+atkinson+dithering+algorithm">Atkinson’s genius dithering algorithm</a> was my inspiration for the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_dithering">Dithering</a>, my podcast with Ben Thompson. I find that effect beautiful and love that it continues to prove useful, like on the <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/06/10/bitcam">apps like BitCam</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to his low-level contributions like QuickDraw, Atkinson was also <a href="https://www.folklore.org/MacPaint_Evolution.html">the creator of MacPaint</a> (which to this day stands as the model for bitmap image editors — Photoshop, I would argue, was conceptually derived directly from MacPaint) and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/06/17/hypercard">HyperCard</a> (“<a href="https://www.folklore.org/Joining_Apple_Computer.html">inspired by a mind-expanding LSD journey in 1985</a>”), the influence of which cannot be overstated.</p>

<p>I say this with no hyperbole: Bill Atkinson may well have been the best computer programmer who ever lived. Without question, he’s on the short list. What a man, what a mind, what gifts to the world he left us.</p>

<p>Kyle Hughes, in a brief thread on Mastodon last week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At work I’m developing a new iOS app on a small team alongside a
small Android team doing the same. We are getting lapped to an
unfathomable degree because of how productive they are with
Kotlin, Compose, and Cursor. They are able to support all the way
back to Android 10 (2019) with the latest features; we are
targeting iOS 16 (2022) and have to make huge sacrifices (e.g
Observable, parameter packs in generics on types). Swift 6 makes a
mockery of LLMs. It is almost untenable.</p>

<p>This wasn’t the case in the 2010s. The quality and speed of
implementation of every iOS app I have ever worked on, in teams of
every size, absolutely cooked Android. [...] There has never been
a worse time in the history of computers to launch, and require,
fundamental and sweeping changes to languages and frameworks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem isn’t necessarily inherent to the design of the Swift language, but that throughout Swift’s evolution Apple has introduced sweeping changes with each major new version. (Secondarily, that compared to other languages, a lower percentage of Swift code that’s written is open source, and thus available to LLMs for use in training corpuses.) Swift was introduced at WWDC 2014 (that one <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/07/long-lost-df-post">again</a>) and last year Apple introduced Swift 6. That’s a lot of major version changes for a programming language in one decade. There were pros and cons to Apple’s approach over the last decade. But now there’s a new, and major con: because Swift 6 only debuted last year, there’s no great corpus of Swift 6 code for LLMs to have trained on, and so they’re just not as good — from what I gather, not <em>nearly</em> as good — at generating Swift 6 code as they are at generating code in other languages, and for other programming frameworks like React.</p>

<p>The new features in Swift 6 are for the better, but, in a group chat, my friend <a href="https://bitsplitting.org/">Daniel Jalkut</a> described them to me as, “I think Swift 6 changed very little, but the little it changed has huge sweeping implications. Akin to the switch from <a href="https://medium.com/@yenatlij/memory-management-in-objective-c-mrr-and-arc-473cb769fb8d">MRR to ARC</a>.” That’s a reference to the change in Objective-C memory management from manual retain/release (MRR) to automatic reference counting (ARC) back in 2011. Once ARC came out, no one wanted to be writing new code using manual retain/release (which was both tedious and a common source of memory-leak bugs). But if LLMs had been around in 2011/2012, they’d only have been able to generate MRR Objective-C code because that’s what all the existing code they’d been trained on used.</p>

<p>I’m quite certain everyone at Apple who ought to be concerned about this <em>is</em> concerned about it. The question is, do they have solutions ready to be announced next week? This whole area — language, frameworks, and tooling in the LLM era — is top of mind for me heading into WWDC next week.</p>

<p>Thomas Ptacek:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>LLMs can write a large fraction of all the tedious code you’ll
ever need to write. And most code on most projects is tedious.
LLMs drastically reduce the number of things you’ll ever need to
Google. They look things up themselves. Most importantly, they
don’t get tired; they’re immune to inertia.</p>

<p>Think of anything you wanted to build but didn’t. You tried to
home in on some first steps. If you’d been in the limerent
phase of a new programming language, you’d have started
writing. But you weren’t, so you put it off, for a day, a year,
or your whole career.</p>

<p>I can feel my blood pressure rising thinking of all the
bookkeeping and Googling and dependency drama of a new project. An
LLM can be instructed to just figure all that shit out. Often, it
will drop you precisely at that golden moment where shit almost
works, and development means tweaking code and immediately seeing
things work better. That dopamine hit is why I code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ptacek says he mostly writes in Go and Python, and his essay doesn’t even mention Swift. But the whole essay is worth keeping in mind ahead of WWDC. There is no aspect of the AI revolution where Apple, right now today, is further behind than agentic LLM programming. (Swift Assist, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/apple-empowers-developers-and-fuels-innovation-with-new-tools-and-resources/">announced</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/15/swift-assist-voorhees">even demoed</a> last year at WWDC, would have been a first step in this direction, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/13/whither-swift-assist">but it never shipped</a>, even in beta.)</p>

<p>I don’t use the web interface to <a href="https://movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>, my moribund-but-works-just-great CMS, very often. But I was using it today and noticed something odd. Next to the small-text metadata that says I’ve written 35,086 entries in total, it said I had one draft. One. I don’t use the drafts feature in Movable Type — my drafts are stored locally as text files in BBEdit or unpublished posts in MarsEdit. I didn’t recall <em>ever</em> saving a draft in Movable Type, but, I thought to myself, I probably did it from my phone — which is the one device where I do publish and edit posts through the MT web interface because (to my knowledge) there’s no equivalent of MarsEdit for iOS.</p>

<p>It was a Linked List post pointing to <a href="https://lefsetz.com/wordpress/2014/05/29/beats-deal/">Bob Lefsetz’s reaction</a> to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2014/05/28Apple-to-Acquire-Beats-Music-Beats-Electronics/">then-new Beats acquisition by Apple</a> for $3 billion, which was considered a lot of money for an acquisition at the time. The blockquote wasn’t fully Markdown-formatted yet — which is sort of tedious for me on the phone, but a single keyboard shortcut in either BBEdit or MarsEdit on my Mac. That’s probably why I left it as a draft. So, just now, I finished the formatting, and changed it from draft to published. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/06/01/lefsetz">Voila</a> — a post I wrote on 1 June 2014 that hadn’t been published until a few minutes ago. I suspect many of you will think Lefsetz’s 2014 remarks on Tim Cook ring more true today than they did then. Others (I’m more in this camp) look at Lefsetz’s 2014 remarks as more than a little absurd — the only mark Jimmy Iovine left at Apple was the record for being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqQ6D0Bu-a8">the least prepared executive ever to appear on stage in a keynote</a>. He was like Biden at the debate up there.</p>

<p>Lending strong credence to my theory that this forgotten draft was created on my phone is that 1 June 2014 was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2014/06/wwdc_2014_prelude">the Sunday before WWDC 2014</a>, when I’d have been travelling, and thus using my phone for posting. Funny coincidence that I happened to notice it today, on the cusp of WWDC 2025.</p>

<p>A brief follow-up to my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/04/apple-iphone-air-battery-case-or-pack">love letter to Apple’s discontinued MagSafe Battery Pack</a> this week. I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They’re the only Lightning devices left in my life and they’re so
good I’m happy to still keep one Lightning cable in my travel bag
to use them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among its other unique bits of cleverness, Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack supports another cool feature: when attached to your phone, you can plug the charging cable into the phone, and after the phone gets to 100 percent charge, the phone will recharge the connected battery pack. So, if you own a MagSafe Battery Pack, you can recharge it even if you don’t have a Lightning cable handy. Just attach it to your iPhone and plug your USB-C cable into the phone, not the battery pack. I’m not aware of any other battery packs that support this.</p>

<p>That said, I still keep that one Lightning cable in my travel bag for the MagSafe Battery Pack because I want to be able to charge it whenever I want. Like, say, if I want to leave it behind, recharging, while I go elsewhere with my iPhone. Also, I like using the MagSafe Battery Pack as my bedside MagSafe charger. I like being able to check my phone from bed without worrying about a cable. In fact, I use one of my MagSafe Battery Packs as my bedside charger at home, not just while travelling.</p>

<p>Such a great little device. Really hope they make a sequel.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>WhatsApp, on their official blog back in April 2023:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last year, we introduced the ability for users globally to
<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/14/security/whatsapp-multi-device/">message seamlessly across all their devices</a>, while
maintaining the same level of privacy and security.</p>

<p>Today, we’re improving our multi-device offering further by
<em>introducing the ability to use the same WhatsApp account on
multiple phones</em>.</p>

<p>A feature highly requested by users, now you can link your phone
as one of up to four additional devices, the same as when you link
with WhatsApp on <a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/">web browsers</a>, <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download">tablets and desktops</a>.
Each linked phone connects to WhatsApp independently, ensuring
that your personal messages, media, and calls are end-to-end
encrypted, and if your primary device is inactive for a long
period, we automatically log you out of all companion devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I wrote about WhatsApp <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/02/whatsapp-for-ipad">finally shipping for iPad earlier this week</a>, I mentioned that you couldn’t use a secondary phone as a linked device to your primary phone. That used to be true, but obviously, I missed that this changed two years ago. Glad to know it. I’ve already added my Android burner and my spare iPhone that I use for summer iOS betas. <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/1317564962315842/?cms_platform=android">WhatsApp has a support document on linking devices</a> that explains the somewhat hidden way you do this with a secondary phone. My thanks to several readers who pointed me to this.</p>

<p>This makes it seem all the more spiteful, though, that Meta didn’t allow the iPhone version of WhatsApp to run on iPads (like they do with the still-iPhone-only Instagram app). I heard from a little birdie this week — second- or maybe even third-hand, so take it with a grain of salt — that Meta had this WhatsApp for iPad version ready to go for a while, and has been more or less sitting on an iPad version of Instagram, as a couple negotiating chits with Apple. Negotiating for what, I don’t know. But if that’s true, perhaps some (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/04/meta-and-yandexs-local-mess-exploit-seemingly-only-works-on-android">but definitely not all</a>) of the ice has thawed between the two companies. I don’t see it happening, but it sure would get a big audience response if Instagram for iPad got some sort of announcement during the WWDC keynote, perhaps as part of an “<em>iPadOS is now a fuller, more complete, computing experience than ever</em>” segment.</p>

<p>One other oddity I encountered, when adding my Android phone as a linked device: by design, <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/5550163238402916">there is no way to sign out of WhatsApp on your primary iOS or Android device</a>. If you are signed in to WhatsApp using another phone number, the only way to sign out on that device and then set it up as a linked device to your primary WhatsApp account is to delete WhatsApp from your phone and reinstall it. Weird.</p>

<p>Tom Warren, writing for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The experience supports Markdown style input and files for users
who prefer to work directly with the lightweight markup language,”
explains Dave Grochocki, principal product manager lead for
Microsoft’s Windows inbox apps. “You can switch between formatted
Markdown and Markdown syntax views in the view menu or by
selecting the toggle button in the status bar at the bottom of the
window.”</p>

<p>Since Notepad is usually used with plain text, you can also easily
clear all formatting from the formatting toolbar or from the edit
menu in the app. If you’re not a fan of the lightweight formatting
options, you can also fully disable this new support in the
Notepad app settings. [...]</p>

<p>Like I wrote in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/676258/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-steamos-notepad">my Notepad newsletter earlier this week</a>,
it’s amazing that Microsoft barely touched Notepad for decades,
and now it’s gone from basic log file reader to writing messages
itself. A lot of Notepad’s new features have arrived since
Microsoft decided to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/3/23857331/microsoft-wordpad-windows-removal-end-of-support">remove WordPad from Windows</a>, after
nearly 30 years.</p>

<p>I posted this update a bit ago, but it’s worth making a separate post so you don’t miss it if you read the original post before I added the update:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It goes without saying that any consumer survey is only as good as
the surveyor. But CIRP, in particular, has posted some dubious
ones, to say the least. <a href="https://mastodon.social/@lapcatsoftware/114638324316925437">Jeff Johnson pointed out on Mastodon</a>
that back in 2023, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/09/apples-most-popular-mac/">CIRP published a survey that claimed the Mac
Pro accounted for 43 percent</a> of all Mac desktop sales, with
the Mac Mini and Mac Studio each accounting for only 4 percent
each. That’s just bananas. That’s not like <em>maybe wrong</em>, that’s
not <em>gotta be a little wrong</em>, that’s <em>how could anyone publish
this?</em> wrong. It’s hard to believe anything from CIRP after they
published that.</p>

<p>I think it’s become tradition for Mark Gurman to run a mega spoiler report on the WWDC keynote the Friday before. Don’t read it if you don’t want to see a <em>lot</em> of genuine spoilers. But here are a few non-spoilers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The AI changes will be surprisingly minor and are unlikely to
impress industry watchers, especially considering the rapid pace
of innovation by Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Meta Platforms Inc.,
Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know a single person who will be surprised if Apple’s in-house AI changes are minor. Literally, not one. The only way for Apple to surprise on the AI front would be for the improvements to be major. Who’s the guy who will be surprised by underwhelming advances on the AI front from Apple next week? <a href="https://crazyapplerumors.com/2006/08/21/everybody-tired-of-one-mac-user/">Artie MacStrawman</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While there has been speculation that the app icons will be round
to match the style on the Apple Watch and Vision Pro, the shape is
staying largely the same on the iPhone and iPad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Always beware the passive voice. “There has been speculation”? It was Gurman’s own report, back in March, that left some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/ios-19-visionos-apple-massive-ui-overhaul/">with the decided impression</a> that Apple was making icons circular across all platforms under the nonsensical argument that users find it jarring to see differently-shaped icons on different devices. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/apple-readies-dramatic-design-overhauls-for-ios-19-ipados-19-and-macos-16?embedded-checkout=true">Gurman, back in March</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A key goal of the overhaul is to make Apple’s different operating
systems look similar and more consistent. Right now, the
applications, icons and window styles vary across macOS, iOS and
visionOS. That can make it jarring to hop from one device to
another. [...]</p>

<p>VisionOS differs from iOS and macOS in the use of circular app
icons, a simplified approach to windows, translucent panels for
navigation, and a more prominent use of 3D depth and shadows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My guess is that if Apple does go with circular icons across all platforms next week (which I sure hope they don’t because that seems dumb), Gurman will take credit for calling it back in March, despite writing today that “the shape is staying largely the same”. Heads, Gurman wins. Tails, Gurman doesn’t lose.</p>

<p>Back to today’s mega-spoiler report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Camera app will be revamped with a focus on simplicity. Apple
has added several new photo and video-taking options in recent
years — including spatial video, panorama and slow-motion
recording — and that’s made today’s interface a bit clunky. In
iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, Apple is rethinking the approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can’t recall seeing Gurman ever, not even once, crediting anyone else for scooping anything first. Jon Prosser made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaP_q9W3AQE">an entire video about the supposed new Camera app design</a> all the way back on January 17, replete with animated mockups of how it will look and work. (Looks pretty clever to me, starting with a back-to-basics simple focus on two main modes — Photo or Video — and putting all other sub-modes under those.)</p>

	<summary type="text">Truth Social is exceedingly unpopular when judged as a social network; but it’s exceedingly successful as a blog. All the other people using Truth Social are effectively reading his blog and shitposting comments and memes in response to his posts.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Sarah Perez, TechCrunch, “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/06/the-trump-musk-feud-has-been-great-for-x-which-jumped-up-the-app-store-charts/">The Trump-Musk Feud Has Been Great for X, Which Jumped Up the App Store Charts</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/why-are-elon-musk-and-donald-trump-fighting/">feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump</a> may be
bad for the MAGA camp, but it’s proven to be beneficial for X,
which has seen engagement soaring over the past 24 hours.
According to new data from Sensor Tower, the app formerly known as
Twitter skyrocketed up the U.S. App Store’s top charts, landing at
the 23rd overall spot on June 5 — up from an average rank of No.
68 over the last 30 days.</p>

<p>X also saw an average rank of No. 58 over the past six months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn’t call jumping from the 60s to the 20s “skyrocketing”, but, up is up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trump’s own social network, Truth Social, benefited from the feud
as well, as the president shared his thoughts about Musk with his
followers. Compared with the last seven days, U.S. mobile app
active users on Truth Social increased by more than 400%, Sensor
Tower’s proprietary panel indicates.</p>

<p>However, X is still much larger than Truth Social, Sensor Tower
notes, as it has 100× more U.S. mobile app users than Trump’s
social network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a couple of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/19/trump-walmart-tariffs">recent</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/23/trump-cook-apple-india">posts</a> I’ve referred to Truth Social as Trump’s “blog”. (I expounded upon this <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/05/26/ep-422">in a recent episode of The Talk Show</a>, with Stephen Hackett, starting after the 1h:20m mark, so if you listened to that, the following will sound familiar.) Long before this easily-predictable breakup of two unstable sociopathic egomaniacs (and who would be genuinely surprised if Musk is back in the Oval Office next week?), I’ve long wondered about one particular aspect of their alliance. To wit: that Musk famously spent $44 billion to buy Twitter/X, and envisions it as a world-conquering “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/10/everything">everything app</a>”. Trump was once the best known user on Twitter, but after being kicked off every legitimate social network after trying to overthrow the 2020 election, Trump started his own ostensible Twitter-like network, Truth Social. Ostensibly, they’re in direct competition with each other.</p>

<p>Did Musk ever pitch Trump on shutting Truth Social down and coming back to X full time? How about buying Truth Social for a bribery price of a cool $1 billion to sweeten the deal? Truth Social isn’t really a functional social network. Let’s stipulate that Truth Social has 1 percent the active US mobile users of X. Even that’s a sham. <em>Nobody of note other than Trump himself uses Truth Social.</em> For all the pathetic obsequiousness of every single lickspittle official serving in the Trump 2.0 administration, none of them are even vaguely active on Truth Social. They’re all still on X. The Justice Department posts to <a href="https://x.com/TheJusticeDept">its official account on X</a> multiple times per day, but the DOJ doesn’t even have an account on Truth Social. OK, JD Vance has posted to <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@JDVance1">his Truth Social account</a> about a dozen times in the last month. But <a href="https://x.com/JDVance">he’s posted to X</a> five times <em>today</em>.</p>

<p>What I’ve realized is that Truth Social is essentially just Trump’s blog. Truth Social is exceedingly unpopular when judged as a social network; but it’s exceedingly successful as a blog. All the other people using Truth Social are effectively reading his blog and shitposting comments and memes in response to his posts, trying to get his attention. I’ve been thinking about this for a few weeks, and in that time, Trump’s own posts on Truth Social have made the news on a near-daily basis. I’ve never once, ever, seen a post from anyone else on Truth Social make the news. Trump is not just the one and only person of consequence using it, his is the one and only account on Truth Social that you ever, <em>ever</em> hear about.</p>

<p>If Truth Social were actually <em>meant</em> to compete with X, Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon, this almost certainly would have been a source of conflict between Trump and Musk. Because, if it were meant to be an actual competitive social network, it would occur to Trump to require all his flunkeys and toadies not only to post to Truth Social, but to <em>stop</em> posting to X. But he hasn’t done that, because Truth Social is functioning as intended: it’s just an outlet for Trump to spew his demented <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/23/trump-cook-apple-india">mad-king musings</a> (today he’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/trump-retweet-rushmore.jpeg">retweeting calls</a> for him to be added to Mount Rushmore) and, most importantly, get some of his all-caps-laden bangers read aloud on the TV news.</p>

<p>Ryan Christoffel, writing at 9to5Mac regarding <a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/rethinking-the-apple-ecosystem">a paywalled survey report from CIRP</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CIRP recently performed a survey of Apple customers to get a sense
of how the company’s three tentpole products — iPhone, iPad, and
Mac — are performing. One focus was on understanding the power of
Apple’s ecosystem, as determined by customers who own multiple
products.</p>

<p><a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/rethinking-the-apple-ecosystem">Michael Levin and Josh Lowitz write at CIRP</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iPhone remains the most dominant product, with 94% of recent
Apple customers owning one. iPads are next, with 78% owning one.
Mac computers have much smaller penetration, at 36% of recent
customers.</p>

<p>74% of customers, virtually all iPad owners, own an iPad and an
iPhone. Only 30% own all three, as that number is limited by
Apple customers’ relative lack of Macs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Different people may draw their own conclusions on the data, but
for me, the most interesting element is easily the iPad’s
popularity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t find this surprising. But if it’s true, it truly shows just how much longer people hold onto their iPads than their iPhones. If the average customer replaced their iPad as frequently as they do their iPhone, you’d expect Apple’s iPad revenue to be remarkably close to their iPhone revenue. But they’re not close. <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/05/apple-q2-2025-results-and-charts-95-4b-revenue/">In their most recent quarter</a>, iPhone revenue was 7× iPad revenue. And Mac revenue was slightly ahead of iPad revenue — but that might be more a function of average selling prices being so much higher for Macs than iPads, not replacement cycles.</p>

<p><strong id="update">Update:</strong> It goes without saying that any consumer survey is only as good as the surveyor. But CIRP, in particular, has posted some dubious ones, to say the least. <a href="https://mastodon.social/@lapcatsoftware/114638324316925437">Jeff Johnson pointed out on Mastodon</a> that back in 2023, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/09/apples-most-popular-mac/">CIRP published a survey that claimed the Mac Pro accounted for 43 percent</a> of all Mac desktop sales, with the Mac Mini and Mac Studio each accounting for only 4 percent each. That’s just bananas. That’s not like <em>maybe wrong</em>, that’s not <em>gotta be a little wrong</em>, that’s <em>how could anyone publish this?</em> wrong. It’s hard to believe anything from CIRP after they published that.</p>

<p>Jérôme Marin, writing at Cafétech:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The disagreement between Apple and Brussels centers on Article
5.4. In its English version, the article states that the
gatekeeper — the term used by the Commission for the seven major
tech companies subject to the DMA — <em>“shall allow business users,
free of charge, to communicate and promote offers, including under
different conditions […], and to conclude contracts with those end
users.”</em></p>

<p>This lengthy sentence creates ambiguity: what exactly does <em>“free
of charge”</em> apply to? Apple claims it only applies to
<em>“communicate”</em> and <em>“promote,”</em> meaning the right to insert
redirect links in an app. But not to <em>“conclude contracts,”</em>
meaning making purchases. Based on that, Apple argues it can still
charge commissions on those external transactions.</p>

<p>The European Commission interprets it differently: contract
conclusion must also be free of charge. It relies on the comma
before the phrase <em>“and to conclude contracts,”</em> turning the
sentence into an <em>“enumeration.” “That ‘free of charge’ applies to
all that is being enumerated after”,</em> it explains in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202522/DMA_100109_906.pdf">its detailed
decision sent to Apple</a> as part of the €500 million fine,
which was made public last week.</p>

<p><em>“In other words, the price for app developers to pay [for
external purchases] is zero,”</em> writes the Commission. However, its
case could be weakened by inconsistencies in the French and German
translations of the text, which it acknowledges are <em>“ambiguous.”</em>
Still, <em>“other linguistic versions leave no room for
interpretation,”</em> notes Brussels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand why EU laws are published in multiple languages, but it’s wild that that can create possible loopholes like this. But it seems rather obvious what the EC’s intention was here, and it wasn’t for Apple to charge commissions — let alone steep commissions — on transactions that take place outside the app after users tap a link to the web. If I were one of Apple’s lawyers, I’d argue about the placement of a comma too, and what it implies about what “free of charge” applies to. But the EC’s intentions are obvious. It’s not really about a comma.</p>

<p>On this particular issue Apple seems to be facing the exact same pushback in the EU <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/05/apple-appeal-denied-antisteering">as in the US</a>: their anti-steering rules in the App Store aren’t legal.</p>

<p>Nice write-up from Zac Hall at 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Theater for visionOS <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/10/sandwich-debuts-theater-for-vision-pro-with-exclusive-the-talk-show-live-event-in-immersive-video/">premiered</a> a year ago with a clever
software launch campaign: exclusively streaming John Gruber’s The
Talk Show post-WWDC event live with 3D video.</p>

<p>The Apple Vision Pro app has continued to mature since its debut,<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/06/the-best-plex-video-player-for-apple-vision-pro-just-got-way-better/">
adding extensive Plex support</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/12/23/apple-vision-pro-just-got-a-planetarium-and-its-friggin-awesome/">a full-blown immersive
planetarium</a> that now hosts the <a href="https://sandwich.vision/press/partners/resolution-press-release.html">2025 SXSW award-winning
“Resolution” music experience</a>.</p>

<p>Next up, Theater is returning as the exclusive home to The Talk
Show Live event stream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, as Hall points out, if you haven’t heard or thought about the Theater app for VisionOS since my show last year, there is now a ton of interesting immersive content there. Second, I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve read commentary, or listened to people on podcasts, wonder why there are hardly any “<em>just make it feel like you’re there, in the audience, for the show</em>” immersive shows for VisionOS.</p>

<p>That’s what Sandwich Vision did last year, and is doing even better this year, with my show. I thought it was kind of odd that it was me, of all people, and my once-a-year, not-that-big-a-deal-outside-the-Apple-nerd-media-world show, who was the first to livestream an immersive show experience for VisionOS. Maybe there were others first for Meta’s low-res headsets, but if there were, I’m not aware of them. My show last year really might have been first for any immersive headset.</p>

<p>Afterward, I figured by this year, while it might not be commonplace — simply because Vision Pro ownership is, you know, not that high — it wouldn’t be unusual. But it still is. I honestly don’t get why that is. Anyway, like I wrote in the previous post, if you can make the show, <a href="https://ti.to/daringfireball/the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2025">you really should attend</a>. But if you can’t make the show, you definitely should watch live <a href="https://theater.sandwich.vision/">in Theater</a>.</p>

<p>Sandwich Vision:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Theater, the premier platform for spatial media, cinema and events
on Apple Vision Pro, is proud to announce the immersive livestream
of The Talk Show Live from WWDC on Tuesday, June 10, 2025.</p>

<p>Following last year’s groundbreaking first-ever immersive
livestream of the event from John Gruber, host of The Talk Show
podcast and author of the renowned Apple blog Daring Fireball,
Theater returns with an enhanced experience that builds on a full
year of platform development and partnerships.</p>

<p>“When we launched Theater last year to showcase The Talk Show
Live, we weren’t just experimenting — we were inviting people to
experience a new kind of immersion. Bringing Apple executives into
spatial media wasn’t just a world first; it was a glimpse of how
shared experiences can transcend screens,” said Adam Lisagor, CEO
and founder of Sandwich Vision. “This year, we’re not just adding
features — we’re refining how people can feel connected, curious,
and delighted together, again and again. Our goal is to make
presence and participation the new standard for special events,
where technology fades away, and what remains is the shared magic
of being there.”</p>

<p>The livestream will be available in both 2D and 3D formats. While
the 2D stream will be offered free of charge, the premium 3D
immersive experience will be available for $11.99 for tickets
purchased in advance, increasing to $14.99 on the day of the
event. All ticket holders will receive permanent access to a
pristine 6K version of the event to watch forever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make your purchases right in the <a href="https://theater.sandwich.vision/">Theater app</a>. I’m snarky in the press release linked above, but I actually thought doing this last year was incredibly cool. Afterwards it was like I got to watch myself perform my own show, which was a lot weirder than just watching myself on regular video.</p>

<p>If you can make the show, <a href="https://ti.to/daringfireball/the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2025">you really should attend</a>. Everyone tells me it’s fun. But if you can’t make the show, you definitely should watch live in Theater.</p>

<p>Jacob Kastrenakes, The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In April, a federal judge demanded that Apple begin allowing web
links, cease restricting how links are formatted, and enable
developers to offer external payment options without giving the
company a cut of their revenue. Apple promptly appealed and
requested that the order be put on hold until the legal
proceedings were finished.</p>

<p>But an appeals court has now denied Apple’s emergency request to
block the order. The court said it was “not persuaded” that
blocking the order was appropriate after weighing Apple’s chances
to succeed on appeal, whether Apple would be irreparably harmed,
whether other parties would be hurt if the order is halted, and
what supports the public interest.</p>

<p>The rejection bodes poorly for Apple’s chance of overturning the
order, which stems from a lawsuit by Epic Games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s the denial <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70190916/40/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/">from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a>, nearly in its entirety, omitting only legal citations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s Emergency Motion Under Circuit Rule 27-3 for a Partial
Stay Pending Appeal is DENIED. In deciding whether to impose a
stay, we consider: “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a
strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2)
whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay;
(3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the
other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the
public interest lies.” Apple “bears the burden of showing that the
circumstances justify an exercise of [our] discretion.” After
reviewing the relevant factors, we are not persuaded that a stay
is appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The earliest this might get overturned, it seems to me, is the end of this year, but I get the feeling this injunction is here to stay.</p>

<p>Marco Arment, moved to write his first blog post in 11 months:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For unspecified reasons, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/29/the-talk-show-live-tickets-2025">Apple has declined to participate this
year</a>, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our
community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back.
(<a href="https://marco.org/2021/06/03/developer-relations">A lot has changed</a> in the meantime.)</p>

<p>Maybe Apple has good reasons. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">Maybe not</a>. We’ll see what
their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that
Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human,
unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and
that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation
to our community and developers in this way.</p>

<p>I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case
for long.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They’ve invited members of the media to a screening of <em>F1 The Movie</em> Tuesday at 7:00pm in the Steve Jobs Theater. Thankfully, my press invitation from Apple has it marked as “optional”, because I have <a href="https://ti.to/daringfireball/the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2025">a conflict</a>.</p>

<p>Marcus Mendes, in a piece at 9to5Mac with multiple spoilers for next week’s keynote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is working on supporting the ability to export notes in
Markdown from Apple Notes, which is something third-party apps
have supported for years. Granted, this is a niche feature, but as
a fierce participant in the niche, I can confirm: this is huge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When this story first started spreading this morning, it was getting repeated as Notes “gaining Markdown support”, which implied something like <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a> or <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, where you can type Markdown syntax characters while editing, and perhaps optionally see the Markdown syntax in your notes. “Markdown notes app” is really like a class of notes apps unto itself.</p>

<p>Some people find this surprising, but I personally don’t want to use a Markdown notes app. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/dive_into_markdown">I created Markdown two decades ago</a> and have used it ever since for one thing and one thing only: writing for the web at Daring Fireball. My <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">original description</a> of what it is still stands: “Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.” Perhaps an even better description of Markdown is Matthew Butterick’s, <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/quick-tour.html#%28part._.Markdown_mode%29">from the documentation for Pollen</a>: “Markdown is a simplified notation system for HTML.”</p>

<p>The other great use case for Markdown is in a context where you either <em>need</em> or just <em>want</em> to be saving to a plain text file or database field. That’s not what Apple Notes is or should be. I can see why many technically-minded people want to use Markdown “everywhere”. It’s quite gratifying that Markdown has not only become so popular, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/introducing_markdown">after 21 years</a>, continues to grow in popularity, to the point now where there clearly are a lot of people who seemingly enjoy writing in Markdown more than even I do. But I think it would be a huge mistake for Apple to make Apple Notes a “Markdown editor”, even as an option. It’s trivial to create malformed Markdown syntax; it shouldn’t be possible to have a malformed note in Apple Notes. I <em>craft</em> posts for Daring Fireball; I dash off notes in Apple Notes.</p>

<p>Apple Notes offers a great WYSIWYG rich text editing interface that works great on an iPhone and even better on a Mac, which I think is exactly appropriate. Particularly clever are the limited formatting options, where you don’t pick a font per se, but rather only from a set of predefined styles, like headings, lists, and block quote. It’s not nerdy at all. You certainly shouldn’t need to “preview” (let alone keep a separate preview view open side-by-side with your editing view), nor switch between <a href="https://www.pavley.com/2020/02/20/no-modes/">modes</a> for editing and viewing. That’s the Macintosh way. (But that’s why I think Apple Notes’s use of hashtags, rather than real tokenized tags <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/tag-files-and-folders-mchlp15236/mac">like in the Finder</a>, was an enormous mistake on Apple’s part. Real tokenized tags can contain spaces (so a multi-word tag can just be “Words Written Naturally” not “#WordsCrammedTogether”) and don’t need to be prefixed with an ugly, nerdy-looking <code>#</code> character. Notes using hashtags is like if the Finder disallowed spaces and uppercase letters in filenames.)</p>

<p>But Markdown <em>export</em> from Notes? That sounds awesome. Frankly, perhaps the biggest problem with Apple Notes is that its export functionality is rather crude — <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/export-or-print-notes-iphdf551cfa2/ios">PDF and, of all formats, Pages</a>. Exporting and/or copying the selected text as Markdown would be pretty cool. Very curious to see how they handle images though, if this rumor is true.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Wayne Ma, reporting last month at The Information (a paywalled website so obnoxious that they force $300/year subscribers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lqstgf7nt62r">to click through an article-blocking popover</a> pitching them on upgrading to a $500/year subscription), and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/">summarized here by MacRumors</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, the smaller size of the new thin model will require
compromises to its capabilities. The device will contain only a
single speaker instead of the two speakers that Apple’s other
phones usually have, one rear camera lens instead of the three in
Apple’s flagship phones, and reduced battery life. Internal
testing shows that battery life for the thin model will fall short
of that of previous iPhones. The percentage of users who can go a
single day without recharging the thin phone will be between 60%
and 70%. For other models, that metric is between 80% and 90%, one
of the people said.</p>

<p>To solve this, Apple is developing an optional accessory — a
phone case meant for the thin model that also contains a battery
pack, according to three people familiar with the matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sort of goes without saying that the super-thin iPhone will have less battery life. How could it be otherwise? If 60–70% of users can still get through the day on a charge while using it, that sounds like it’s the right time for Apple to try such a phone. People who currently run their phones down to the red each day aren’t going to think “<em>Hey, maybe I should try this crazy thin iPhone.</em>”</p>

<p>What disappoints me is Ma’s reporting of an iPhone Air-only battery <em>case</em> from Apple. What I very much want Apple to make is a sequel to its amazing <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111857">MagSafe Battery Pack with a Lightning connector</a> that debuted in 2020 but was discontinued in 2023 (the year that the iPhones 15 switched from Lightning to USB-C). I’ve got two of these and they’re still, by far, my favorite iPhone battery packs. They’re the only Lightning devices left in my life and they’re so good I’m happy to still keep one Lightning cable in my travel bag to use them.</p>

<p>There are a zillion third-party “magnetic” (but not “MagSafe”) battery packs that work with iPhones, and most of them have larger batteries than Apple’s. But part of what makes Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack great is that it’s so small, and shaped so comfortably. I don’t need a magnetic battery pack that tries to double my iPhone’s battery life. I just need like 1.5× on occasional phone-heavy days (like next Monday’s WWDC keynote), and Apple’s does just that. No third-party magnetic battery pack I’ve tried comes even close to attaching as securely to the back of the iPhone as Apple’s. And Apple’s has special integration with iOS, which gives you a cool animation on the screen when it’s first attached, and updates the battery life of the pack in the Battery widget alongside the iPhone’s own battery. (Apparently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLb5ut2mzf4">some newer third-party packs do now show the full-screen animation</a> when first attached, but none yet integrate with the Battery widget — someone better call the European Commission.) Most importantly, with Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack, iOS is smart, and doesn’t keep sucking juice when the phone has recharged up to 70% or so. By only slurping juice when it’s more efficient to do so, you get more effective battery life out of a noticeably slimmer battery back. It’s just so much better than any other battery pack I’ve tried.</p>

<p>This supposed iPhone “Air” seems like the perfect time to bring back the MagSafe Battery Pack, this time with USB-C — and unlike a model-specific case, it’d work with all MagSafe iPhones, not just the Air. (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/the_iphone_16e">Sorry, 16e owners</a>.) See also:</p>

<p>Dan Goodin, writing at Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This abuse has been observed only in Android, and evidence
suggests that the Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica target only
Android users. The researchers say it may be technically feasible
to target iOS because browsers on that platform allow developers
to programmatically <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=279249">establish localhost connections</a> that
apps can monitor on local ports.</p>

<p>In contrast to iOS, however, Android imposes fewer controls on
local host communications and background executions of mobile
apps, the researchers said, while also implementing stricter
controls in app store vetting processes to limit such abuses. This
overly permissive design allows Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica to
send web requests with web tracking identifiers to specific local
ports that are continuously monitored by the Facebook, Instagram,
and Yandex apps. These apps can then link pseudonymous web
identities with actual user identities, even in private browsing
modes, effectively de-anonymizing users’ browsing habits on sites
containing these trackers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll note that among the so-called <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/apple_appeals_eu_interop_requirements">“interoperability” requirements the European Commission is demanding of iOS</a> is for third-party apps to run, unfettered, in the background, because some of Apple’s own first-party software obviously runs in the background. And I’ll further note that Apple made clear, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/DMA-Interoperability-Dec-2024.pdf">back in its December 2024 report laying out its objections to the EC’s demands</a>, that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No company has made more interoperability requests of Apple than
Meta. In many cases, Meta is seeking to alter functionality in a
way that raises concerns about the privacy and security of users,
and that appears to be completely unrelated to the actual use of
Meta external devices, such as Meta smart glasses and Meta Quests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This newly uncovered “Local Mess” exploit — which seemingly only works on Android — is exactly the sort of scheme Meta wants to pull on iOS: to track users across millions of websites while they justifiably believe their web browsing is sandboxed from all native apps.</p>

<p>Back to Goodin:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica are analytics scripts designed to
help advertisers measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.
Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica are estimated to be installed on
<a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Facebook-Pixel%20">5.8 million</a> and <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Yandex-Metrika">3 million</a> sites, respectively.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every one of the sites that includes these tracking scripts is complicit to some extent in the theft of hundreds of millions of Android users’ web browsing privacy.</p>

<p>A team of researchers has uncovered a scheme they’ve dubbed “Local Mess” — used by Meta since September 2024, and Russian search engine Yandex since 2017 (!) — to de-anonymize Android users’ web browsing across millions of websites that include Meta’s and Yandex’s respective tracking scripts. From their extensively detailed report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These native Android apps receive browsers’ metadata, cookies and
commands from the Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica scripts embedded
on thousands of web sites. These JavaScripts load on users’ mobile
browsers and silently connect with native apps running on the same
device through localhost sockets. As native apps access
programmatically device identifiers like the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248">Android Advertising
ID (AAID)</a> or handle user identities as in the case of Meta
apps, this method effectively allows these organizations to <em>link
mobile browsing sessions and web cookies to user identities</em>,
hence de-anonymizing users’ visiting sites embedding their
scripts.</p>

<p>This web-to-app ID sharing method bypasses typical privacy
protections such as clearing cookies, Incognito Mode and Android’s
permission controls. Worse, it opens the door for potentially
malicious apps eavesdropping on users’ web activity. [...]</p>

<p>The entire flow of the _fbp cookie from web to native and the
server is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The user opens the native Facebook or Instagram app, which
eventually is sent to the background and creates a background
service to listen for incoming traffic on a TCP port (12387 or
12388) and a UDP port (the first unoccupied port in
12580-12585). Users must be logged-in with their credentials on
the apps.</li>
<li>The user opens their browser and visits a website integrating
the Meta Pixel.</li>
<li>At this stage, websites may ask for consent depending on the
website’s and visitor’s locations.</li>
<li>The Meta Pixel script sends the <a href="https://localmess.github.io/#about_fbp">_fbp cookie</a> to the
native Instagram or Facebook app via WebRTC (STUN) SDP Munging.</li>
<li>The Meta Pixel script also sends the _fbp value in a request to
https://www.facebook.com/tr along with other parameters such as
page URL (dl), website and browser metadata, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250531104925/https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/reference/">event
type</a> (ev) (e.g., PageView, AddToCart, Donate, Purchase).</li>
<li>The Facebook or Instagram apps receive the _fbp cookie from the
Meta Pixel JavaScript running on the browser. The apps transmit
_fbp as a GraphQL mutation to
(https://graph[.]facebook[.]com/graphql) along with other
persistent user identifiers, linking users’ fbp ID (web visit)
with their Facebook or Instagram account.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The same day the researchers published this report, Meta stopped doing it.</p>

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Adaringfireball.net+facebook+criminal+enterprise&amp;ia=web">I’ve said it before</a> but not in a while: Meta is a criminal enterprise. What they’ve done here may not have broken any laws, but there certainly should be laws against it. And in terms of simple common sense, the entire elaborate scheme <em>only</em> exists to circumvent features in Android meant to <em>prevent</em> native apps from tracking you while you use your web browser. Saying it’s not illegal doesn’t mean it isn’t theft.

<p>Emily Kennard and Margaret Manto, reporting last week for NOTUS (“News of The United States” — a seriously good up-and-coming national affairs publication):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says his “Make America
Healthy Again” Commission report harnesses “gold-standard”
science, citing more than 500 studies and other sources to back up
its claims. Those citations, though, are rife with errors, from
broken links to misstated conclusions.</p>

<p>Seven of the cited sources don’t appear to exist at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shocking that these dipshits would generate their report with whatever came out of an LLM and not actually check — let alone, you know, <em>read</em> — the cited studies.</p>

<p>Nine minutes, short and sweet. I watched the whole thing and loved it.

There’s just something compelling about a live demo, even when you’re watching on YouTube.</p>

<p>(The new PencilVac looks cool too, but it seems too good to be true. I’ll be interested to hear from reviewers whether it, uh, actually sucks or kinda sucks.)</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Sebastiaan de With, in a wonderfully-illustrated piece (a) examining, in detail, where iOS UI has been, and (b) speculating, with detailed mockups, where he thinks/hopes it’s about to go, starting at WWDC next week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’d like to imagine what could come next. Both by rendering some
UI design of my own, and by thinking out what the philosophy of
the New Age could be.</p>

<p>A logical next step could be extending physicality to the entirety
of the interface. We do not have to go overboard in such
treatments, but we can now have the interface inhabit a sense of
tactile realism.</p>

<p>Philosophically, if I was Apple, I’d describe this as finally
having an interface that matches the beautiful material properties
of its devices. All the surfaces of your devices have glass
screens. This brings an interface of a matching material, giving
the user a feeling of the <em>glass itself coming alive</em>. [...]</p>

<p>I took some time to design and theorize what this would look
like, and how it would work. For the New Design Language, it
makes sense that just like on VisionOS, the material of
interactivity is glass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope, very much, that what Apple has been working on is along the lines of what de With has mocked up. It both looks great (and better than what we have now) and <em>makes sense</em>. I also agree with him that it would be a competitive advantage for Apple to establish a new visual design language that no existing design tools can create. You can’t make the sort of things de With is describing with Figma. Competitors could (and I guarantee will) superficially copy the look, but not the interactive responsiveness of lighting effects.</p>

<p>In a profound way, a UI language comprised of glossy and matte glass, running on phones and tablets that themselves are made of glossy and matte glass, would hark back to the early days of Mac OS X, when the “lickable” translucent Aqua UI theme felt of a piece with the colorful translucent plastic enclosures of the iMac, PowerMac, and iBook. Right down to the pinstripes. (Apple never did make an Aqua-style PowerBook along those lines, instead going straight from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_180">classic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_1400">black</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G3">plastic</a> to <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/11/20-macs-for-2020-5-titanium-powerbook-g4/">the Titanium PowerBook G4</a>, the styling of which augured the post-Aqua look-and-feel of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/">Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard</a> and the much-beloved <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6/">10.6 Snow Leopard</a>.) I’ve been clamoring for buttons to look like buttons again ever since iOS 7.</p>

<p>But as much as I truly <em>love</em> de With’s mockups, they’re all for iOS. What I’m left unsettled by is my failure to imagine how this design language could be brought to the Mac. Macs aren’t made of glass; they’re all made of aluminum. But the main difference is that the way many of us use MacOS is with a lot of stacked windows atop each other. The last thing MacOS needs is more transparency/translucency than it already has. Some depth to its UI controls, though? That’s something MacOS is in almost desperate need of. A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a Mac UI theme where you can tell, instantly, <a href="https://erik-engheim.medium.com/big-sur-sucks-817cba889376">whether a button is enabled or disabled</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/l1avfv/tried_to_make_the_ui_buttons_a_bit_more_defined_i/">which item in a tabview controller is selected</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll soon see.</p>

<p>From my 2011 post linking to Fantastical 1.0:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fantastical’s primary innovation is its natural language parser
for event creation — you type something like “Yanks-Rays tonight
at 6:40” and Fantastical not only parses that into a new event,
but, using some very clever animation and design work, shows you
what it thinks you mean before you hit return to actually create
the new event. Watch their screencast to see what I mean.</p>

<p>Four years ago I wrote a piece called “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2007/03/deal_with_it">Deal With It</a>”, about how
some UIs feel like going uphill and some feel like going downhill.
An uphill UI feels like you’re fighting against the app; a
downhill UI makes it feel like the app is helping you along. The
example I chose to illustrate my point was event creation in iCal
(uphill, and steep) vs. 37signals’s Backpack (downhill).
Fantastical is an even better downhill UI for event creation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A friend texted me after my post earlier today, in which <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/03/fantastical-email-event-detection">I wrote about Fantastical’s new AI-driven email forwarding service</a>. My friend wrote that he does this sort of thing with ChatGPT frequently, using photos of event posters he sees on the street or screenshots from event images in Instagram, with a prompt like “Create a Google Calendar link for these.” He concluded, “IMO calendar event entry is one of the most tedious UI problems that we’ve never truly solved.”</p>

<p>I hadn’t revisited my 2007 “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2007/03/deal_with_it">Deal With It</a>” piece in a while, but I just re-read it, and it holds up. I still feel like the UIs that most annoy me are the ones that give me the most fields to deal with. I mention instant messaging vs. email a lot in the piece, coming out squarely on the side of IM for communicating with friends, even for things that I admit probably should have been an email. The predominant messaging platforms of 2007 are now long gone — AIM, ICQ, Yahoo, etc. But those platforms lost only because they were surpassed, not because the basic idea was wrong. Messaging itself — iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, etc. — is a zillion times more popular today. I almost <em>never</em> today think “Maybe that should have been an email...” when I text a friend. There’s just so much less to deal with. Today it’s more likely that I’ll send someone an email and think to myself “I probably should have just texted them that...”</p>

<p>This is one way to frame the explosion in popularity of ChatGPT and its many competitors. They help you accomplish tasks that would <em>feel</em> far more tedious to do on your own than just telling them to do it for you with a sentence or two of plain English describing what you want done, perhaps including a photo or two. LLM chatbots are able to turn <em>feels like pedalling uphill</em> tasks — often just everyday ones — into <em>feels like coasting downhill</em> tasks.</p>

<p>Flexibits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just forward emails to email@fantastical.app from any email

used or retained by Flexibits or Google Cloud for AI training
purposes.</p>

<p>Events that are detected in emails are stored on Flexibits servers
and deleted when you add or discard them in Fantastical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of events in email messages that have always been easy to get into Fantastical (or any other calendar app) because they include an ICS file attachment. Like when I book a flight — I always get an email with an ICS attachment containing the flight details, and I just open that in Fantastical to import it. Forwarding that email to Fantastical would take longer than just opening the attachment. But what about a casual email from a friend or family member that doesn’t come with an attachment?</p>

<p>Here’s an example email I sent to myself from a sort of burner account I have for testing and for doing things like this.</p>

<pre><code>From: Heywood Floyd &lt;heywood••••••••@icloud.com&gt;  
Subject: Party for Hal on Saturday  
Date: June 3, 2025 at 1:22:45 PM EDT  
To: John Gruber &lt;••••••••@daringfireball.net&gt;  

Party at my house is on this Saturday, 12-3 or so.
You don’t have to bring anything.
</code></pre>

<p>That was the entire email, which I deliberately wrote in a very casual way (e.g. “this Saturday” instead of an actual date, and “12-3” as the time, without an explicit “pm”). Forwarded to Fantastical’s new event detection address, well under a minute later I got the following suggested event notification from Fantastical on my Mac:</p>

<pre><code>Title: Party for Hal at Heywood Floyd's house  
Location: Heywood Floyd's house  
Date: 7 June 2025, 12:00pm – 3:00pm  
Note: "You don't have to bring anything."
</code></pre>

<p>Also included in the Note field was a link to the original message in Mail.</p>

<p>In Apple Mail, Siri also suggested an event from the original email. After clicking “Add”, that event had the following details:</p>

<pre><code>Title: Party with Floyd  
Location: «empty»  
Date: 7 June 2025, 12:00pm – 3:00pm  
Note: «empty»
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing in Siri’s auto-detected event was wrong. Both got the date and time right. Siri’s title is fine — in real life, I’d know what that meant. But Fantastical’s title is perfect — it’s a party <em>for</em> Hal, <em>at</em> Heywood’s house. And Siri doesn’t include anything in the Note field, not even a link back to the original message, so it would be up to my own memory to remember where the party was.</p>

<p>To be clear, Fantastical doesn’t just add these events to your calendar. It shows them as suggestions, and there’s a “Preview” button in addition to “Add”. I’ll still preview before adding, but using this service does seem like a decent timesaver for creating new events from casual emails.</p>

<p>Matthew Garrahan, in the Financial Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sir Jony Ive remembers the day in 1997 when he first met Laurene
Powell Jobs, outside the house she shared with her late husband,
Steve. [...]</p>

<p>“I was often at the house,” Ive says. “Certainly on the weekends,”
says Powell Jobs, sitting across from him on a long table. Ive
nods. “It feels to me like we grew up together,” he says. “We’ve
gone through hard things and happy things...”</p>

<p>“... family and children and work,” says Powell Jobs.</p>

<p>“There’s that Freud quote,” Ive says. “All there is, is work and
love. Love and work.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the device(s) Ive is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/21/sam-and-jony-io">spearheading development of at io</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ive deftly dodges my attempts to get him to tell me what it is but
hints he was motivated by a disillusionment with how our
relationship with devices has evolved. “Many of us would say we
have an uneasy relationship with technology at the moment,” he
says. I’m guessing this includes screen addiction and the harms
caused by social media. Whatever the device is, driving its design
is “a sense of: we deserve better. Humanity deserves better.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Powell Jobs as the owner, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/26/the-atlantic-has-an-owner-committed-to-the-cause">committed to the cause</a>, of a major US news publication:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Signalgate story prompted a furious response from the US
president, who called Goldberg a “sleazebag” before inviting him
in for an interview weeks later. “It’s very important to emphasise
that, despite having the majority ownership stake in The Atlantic,
I’m involved in the business side and not the editorial side,”
Powell Jobs says. “We feel very strongly that freedom of the press
means they are free to write the truth as they find it, and follow
a story as they find it. It’s not up to us to approve or
disapprove.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the years after Steve Jobs’s death, while Ive still worked at Apple, I took note that at keynote events, Powell Jobs and Ive always sat next to each other. Always. The media seats are never all that close to the VIP seats in the first two rows, but both of them are rather easily identified by the backs of their heads. I observed, a few times, that in those anxious moments of prelude before a show, the two generally only chatted with each other. I know those first few post-Steve keynotes were emotional for Ive. But I can’t even imagine what they were like for Powell Jobs.</p>

<p>It always moved me to observe that they went through them together, almost literally leaning on each other in their seats.</p>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/02/apple-eu-interoperability-appeal/">Benjamin Mayo, writing at 9to5Mac</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has appealed parts of the Digital Markets Act law citing
user privacy concerns. Specifically, Apple is contesting the
<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/19/eu-order-apple-interoperability/">interoperability requirements</a> that say data like
notification content and WiFi networks should be made available to
third-parties.</p>

<p>Apple says the DMA as written allows others to “access personal
information that even Apple doesn’t see”. This is because features
like notification rendering and WiFi network data are currently
handled on-device and stored in an encrypted fashion, so Apple
cannot see that stuff. However, the DMA does not necessarily
require third-party agents who would be able to access this same
data to commit to the same standards of privacy and security.</p>

<p>Here’s Apple’s latest statement on the matter, in full:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At Apple, we design our technology to work seamlessly together,
so it can deliver the unique experience our users love and expect
from our products. The EU’s interoperability requirements
threaten that foundation, while creating a process that is
unreasonable, costly, and stifles innovation. These requirements
will also hand data-hungry companies sensitive information, which
poses massive privacy and security risks to our EU users.
Companies have already requested our users’ most sensitive data — from the content of their notifications, to a full history of
every stored WiFi network on their device — giving them the
ability to access personal information that even Apple doesn’t
see. In the end, these deeply flawed rules that only target Apple — and no other company — will severely limit our ability to
deliver innovative products and features to Europe, leading to an
inferior user experience for our European customers. We are
appealing these decisions on their behalf, and in order to
preserve the high-quality experience our European customers
expect.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s full statement is worth reading closely. Specifically, this sentence jumped out to me: “In the end, these deeply flawed rules that only target Apple — and no other company — will severely limit our ability to deliver innovative products and features to Europe, leading to an inferior user experience for our European customers.” <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-challenges-eu-order-to-increase-compatibility-with-rivals-products-52082b50?st=gzZzXt">The Wall Street Journal’s story on the appeal</a>, for example, didn’t include that portion of Apple’s statement. But that’s the part that explains what’s going to happen if the EU upholds these “interoperability” requirements, which are intended to require Apple to give away its own intellectual property as though Apple were a public utility. To cite just one example, the Commission’s March ruling requires Apple to make AirDrop available to third-party devices, as though AirDrop was an open standard. (It also requires Apple to allow AirDrop to be replaced on iOS devices, like an interchangeable component, with third-party file sharing software.)</p>

<p>When you think about it, this is nothing like the EU’s recent-ish mandate that most electronic devices must support USB-C ports for charging. I still think that law was unnecessary — the market forces had worked, and the whole world had either already moved (like iPads did starting in 2018) or was on the cusp of moving to USB-C (like iPhones). But at least requiring the inclusion of USB-C for charging is actual open interoperability. USB comes from <a href="https://www.usb.org/">a legitimate industry consortium</a>. Same thing with the Chinese government <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/02/eu_rcs_imessage">seemingly forcing Apple’s hand to adopt RCS</a> in order to get the necessary <a href="https://www.miit.gov.cn/gzcy/yjzj/art/2023/art_2d5a7969581b4b12a78cd2c455649a8c.html">certifications for 5G cellular networking in China</a> — RCS is an industry standard protocol. Mandating the inclusion of a standardized port or standardized protocol is the sort of thing government regulatory bodies do. That’s very different than if the EC had regulated port compatibility by requiring Apple to open up Lightning, or if China had regulated messaging by requiring Apple to open iMessage for other companies to use as though they’re open standards.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/eu-apple-interop-requirements">The EC’s March mandate</a> basically says that third-party devices must be permitted to do everything Apple’s own devices do when it comes to communicating or interoperating with iPhones and iPads, even if that requires allowing those third-party companies to install and run system-level background processes with broad privileges on iOS. In fact, as Mayo alludes to above, in order to have the same capabilities as Apple’s own devices do, third-party system software extensions might need <em>broader</em> privileges.</p>

<p>I’ve long seen that there are two ways Apple can comply with this mandate, if the EU court declines Apple’s appeal. The first is what most people are thinking, and surely what the European Commission’s bureaucrats are thinking: that Apple will somehow make all third-party devices as capable as Apple’s own when it comes to pairing with and communicating with iPhones and iPads. (And that when Apple is set to unveil new devices, they’ll share the details with third parties in advance so they can do the same things.) The second, though, is that Apple will limit its own devices <em>in the EU and only in the EU</em> to the same features available to third-party devices through open standards like Bluetooth. New features and entire devices will either come late, or never, to the EU. We’re already seeing that <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120421">with iPhone Mirroring</a> — perhaps the single best feature Apple announced (and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">actually shipped</a>) last year. I use iPhone Mirroring every day while I’m working. We’re one week out from WWDC 2025 and iPhone Mirroring <em>still</em> isn’t available in the EU. I think it’s very clear that under the EC’s current DMA “interoperability” mandate, Apple would be required to somehow make it work with third-party devices and PCs. If AirDrop were brand new, users in the EU wouldn’t get that either, I suspect. And if this mandate holds up, EU users might <em>lose</em> AirDrop. The same is true of entire devices like AirPods and Apple Watch.</p>

<p>Apple’s statement doesn’t say that complying with these breathtaking demands will adversely affect their customers around the world. They’re saying it will lead “to an inferior user experience for our European customers”. Mandating that the public has to be allowed to use the same doorways as a (say) hotel’s own staff doesn’t mean those existing doors will be opened to everyone. It could lead to those doors being closed to everyone. And all of a sudden no one staying at the hotel is getting food from the kitchen.</p>

<p>WhatsApp:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As one of our biggest requests, we’re excited to announce that
WhatsApp is now available on iPad.[...]</p>

<p>We’ve made WhatsApp for iPad ideal for multitasking so you can get
more done. Take advantage of iPadOS multitasking features such as
Stage Manager, Split View, and Slide Over to view multiple apps at
once, so you can send messages while browsing the web, or research
options for a group trip while on a call together. WhatsApp also
works with your Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the weird things about Meta’s companywide obstinate refusal to adapt its iOS apps for iPadOS is that for WhatsApp, they’ve had a fairly decent <em>Mac</em> app for years. Surely it was less work to adapt their iOS app for iPadOS than it was to create a passable Mac app using Catalyst.</p>

<p>Famously, Instagram doesn’t support iPad screen sizes. You can run and use the iPhone version of Instagram on iPads — and I’m guessing tens of millions of people do — but it’s the clumsy thing where it launches as an iPhone-sized window in the middle of the big iPad display, and you can hit the “double arrows” button to zoom the window to 2× size. You can also use Instagram via the web, on either Mac or iPad, and it’s a pretty full-featured app-like experience.</p>

<p>What was frustrating about WhatsApp’s lack of iPad support until now is that you just couldn’t use WhatsApp at all from an iPad, <a href="https://youtu.be/lqtR0saaSwM?t=35">other than as a web app</a>. Because of the way WhatsApp handles security, you’re really only able to sign in to one “primary” device at a time, and that device must be a phone. Then, what you do to use WhatsApp on other supported platforms is set up those other devices as “<a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/378279804439436/">linked devices</a>” from the WhatsApp app on your primary phone. <s>WhatsApp still doesn’t let you use the same account from more than one phone, which is highly frustrating for those of us with somewhat unusual edge cases like writing reviews of new devices. WhatsApp’s phone apps — for both iOS and Android — can only serve as primary devices. There’s no way to use one phone as “primary” and use WhatsApp on a second phone as a linked device.</s> I’d go nuts if iMessage worked that way. But that’s why, prior to Meta creating a proper iPad app for WhatsApp, you couldn’t just launch the iPhone app on iPad. [<strong>Update, 7 June:</strong> Turns out, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/07/whatsapp-phone-as-linked-device">WhatsApp added support for using phones as linked devices</a> two years ago. We regret the error.]</p>

<p>Mark Gurman reported over the weekend that proper iPad support for Instagram <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-06-01/apple-s-wwdc-2025-plan-macos-tahoe-apple-intelligence-ai-ios-26-games-app-mbdlzqpz">is forthcoming too</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fifteen years after the first iPad went on sale, WhatsApp is now on the tablet. And, yes, it’s just a precursor to the most highly anticipated iPad app ever: Instagram. I’m told that employees on the Meta Platforms Inc. campus are actively testing Instagram for the iPad and that development work is full steam ahead.</p>

<p>Mark Alldritt, Late Night Software:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The day has finally come. After 30 years of continuous
development, Script Debugger has been retired and will no longer
be available for sale. <a href="https://forum.latenightsw.com/t/retiring-script-debugger">Please see this post for more
information</a>.</p>

<p>Over the last few months we have received a wonderful outpouring
of well wishes and stories from our customers describing how
Script Debugger has helped them over the years, via email and on
our <a href="https://forum.latenightsw.com/t/retiring-script-debugger/5071">forum</a>. [...]</p>

<p>Script Debugger is now a free download. Links to all versions of
Script Debugger from 8.0 to 4.0, along with registration numbers,
are available on the <a href="https://latenightsw.com/sd8/download/">Downloads page</a>. These free versions
of Script Debugger are provided AS-IS and without warranty,
maintenance or support.</p>

<p>Those seeking a version of Script Debugger for the Classic MacOS
<a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/7327-script-debugger-3-0-9">should go here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That last paragraph speaks to what an incredible run this has been. 30 years ago was 1995 — which was so solidly in the classic Mac era that the OS was still named “System 7”, not “Mac OS 7”. I forget when I first started using Script Debugger, but it was definitely in the classic Mac era. The oldest license number I still have is for Script Debugger 3.0 in 2005, but I’d been using it for years at that point.</p>

<p>Script Debugger isn’t just a spectacularly good Mac developer tool. (Indispensable, I would say. A lot of the problems many scripters have with AppleScript aren’t just mitigated by using Script Debugger instead of Apple’s free Script Editor — they go away.) It has also always come with spectacularly thorough and exceedingly well-written documentation — a good user manual describes <em>what</em> a product does, but a great one also <a href="https://latenightsw.com/sd7/support/">explains <em>how</em> to use it</a>.</p>

<p>But even better than that, the product always fostered a community of users. You could email tech support for help and get world-class expert personal assistance, or, you could participate in their (still vibrant!) <a href="https://forum.latenightsw.com/t/retiring-script-debugger">user forum</a>. Late Night Software always was a small team — Mark and Shane Stanley for the last decade or so, big contributions from Matt Neuburg, and, for a long (but not long enough) while prior to that, Mark’s late wife <a href="https://markalldritt.com/?page_id=795">Gerry Tubin</a> — whom I had the pleasure of meeting at Macworld Expos of yesteryear. Late Night Software never felt like a “company” per se. It always felt like a team. They exemplified all of the ideals of the indie Mac developer community and culture. At this point, it’s fair to say Late Night Software helped <em>define</em> those ideals.</p>

<p>But all good things come to an end. I haven’t really spent much time thinking about “apps” retiring, even while at the top of their game, but here we are. To Mark and Shane, I offer my profound thanks and sincere congratulations. What a run. Script Debugger is going out on top.</p>

<p>Ever since I started doing these live shows from WWDC, I’ve kept the guest(s) secret, until showtime. I’m still doing that this year. But in recent years the guests have seemed a bit predictable: senior executives from Apple. This year I again extended my usual invitation to Apple, but, for the first time <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2015/06/09/ep-123">since 2015</a>, they declined.</p>

<p>I think this will make for a fascinating show, but I want to set everyone’s expectations accordingly. I’m invigorated by this. See you at the show, I hope.</p>

<p>Tony Romm and Ana Swanson, reporting for The New York Times (paywall-busting gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A panel of federal judges on Wednesday blocked President Trump
from imposing some of his steepest tariffs on China and other U.S.
trading partners, finding that federal law did not grant him
“unbounded authority” to tax imports from nearly every country
around the world.</p>

<p>The ruling, by the U.S. Court of International Trade, delivered an
early yet significant setback to Mr. Trump, undercutting his
primary leverage as he looks to pressure other nations into
striking trade deals more beneficial to the United States.</p>

<p>Before Mr. Trump took office, no president had sought to invoke
the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1977 law, to
impose tariffs on other nations. The law, which primarily concerns
trade embargoes and sanctions, does not even mention tariffs.</p>

<p>But Mr. Trump adopted a novel interpretation of its powers as he
announced, and then suspended, high levies on scores of countries
in April. He also used the law to impose tariffs on products from
Canada and Mexico in return for what he said was their role in
sending fentanyl to the United States.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the Court of International Trade, the primary
federal legal body overseeing such matters, found that Mr. Trump’s
tariffs “exceed any authority granted” to the president by the
emergency powers law. Ruling in separate cases brought by states
and businesses, a bipartisan panel of three judges essentially
declared many, but not all, of Mr. Trump’s tariffs to have been
issued illegally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Enough with the euphemisms. “Novel interpretation” is shorthand for “bullshit mad-king fantasy stuff”. <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/is-there-a-dignified-legal-way-preferably">Paul Krugman, on his blog</a> (which he <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack">really should</a> move away from Substack):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The thing is, it has been obvious all along that Trump’s use of
the 1977 International Economic Emergency Powers Act to justify
Smoot-Hawley level tariffs was a massive abuse of power. I mean,
since when are 4 percent unemployment and 2.5 percent inflation an
emergency justifying the reversal of 90 years of policy? But I
guess I just assumed that things like that didn’t matter anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look past the bluster and Trump <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/28/resistance-is-working">is getting his ass kicked left and right</a>. Every organization — universities, law firms, computer makers — that’s been hesitant to just call his nonsense <em>nonsense</em> and his bullshit <em>bullshit</em> should put their big boy pants on and stand up. The whole thing is falling apart. The system might actually still work. But everyone needs to make their choice known: courage or cowardice?</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Apple Newsroom, yesterday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s strong antifraud infrastructure helps ensure that
malicious developer and customer accounts are swiftly flagged and
eliminated. In 2024, Apple terminated more than 146,000 developer
accounts over fraud concerns and rejected an additional 139,000
developer enrollments, preventing bad actors from submitting their
apps to the App Store in the first place.</p>

<p>Apple also rejected over 711 million customer account creations
and deactivated nearly 129 million customer accounts last year,
blocking these risky and malicious accounts from carrying out
nefarious activity. That includes spamming or manipulating ratings
and reviews, charts, and search results that risk compromising the
integrity of the App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This report isn’t something new that Apple is doing in the face of increased regulatory scrutiny over the exclusivity of the App Store — they’ve been issuing these reports <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/app-store-stopped-over-1-5-billion-in-suspect-transactions-in-2020/">since 2021</a>. <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/annual-fraud-prevention-headlines/">Nick Heer has a good post at Pixel Envy</a> documenting how some of their numbers are seemingly all over the place, year to year.</p>

<p>What some App Store critics argue is that if <em>any</em> substantial amount of fraud, scams, or rip-offs occur through apps distributed through the App Store, that proves that there are no protective benefits of the App Store model. That’s nonsense. There are high-crime cities and low-crime cities, but there exist zero no-crime cities. The question is whether Apple is catching most — or even just “enough” — scammers. Scammy apps, pirated apps, fraudulent app reviewers. You name it. I’ve long suggested that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/bunco+squad">Apple ought to employ a “bunco squad”</a> to crack down on scammers, focusing first and foremost on <em>successful</em> ones. Better to catch one scam with 1,000 victims than 10 scams with one victim each.</p>

<p>I think they could still do better, but I actually think Apple <em>has</em> been doing a better job on this front in recent years. But if your measuring stick is “Are there any successful scams at all in the App Store?” there’s no way Apple is ever going to pass muster. And I think a lot of App Store critics are vastly, vastly underestimating how much fraud Apple is currently stopping that would sail right through if iOS adopted a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/snell-ios-direct-installation-of-apps">Mac-like-style</a> of software distribution. The main difference is that iOS is so much more of a juicy target than MacOS. The other is that I think many people underestimate how many software scams there are on MacOS that wouldn’t work on iOS.</p>

<p>Hell of a scoop from Mark Gurman, at Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The next Apple operating systems will be identified by year,
rather than with a version number, according to people with
knowledge of the matter. That means the current iOS 18 will give
way to “iOS 26,” said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the plan is still private. Other updates will be known as
iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26 and visionOS 26.</p>

<p>Apple is making the change to bring consistency to its branding
and move away from an approach that can be confusing to customers
and developers. Today’s operating systems — including iOS 18,
watchOS 12, macOS 15 and visionOS 2 — use different numbers
because their initial versions didn’t debut at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that they’re on a consistent annual schedule, this supposed new version-numbering scheme makes a lot of sense. It’ll certainly be helpful to anyone trying to figure out what’s up-to-date or not, and it’ll make writing about older OSes much easier. Presuming Gurman is right, this is going to seem really weird at first, and then very quickly seem very natural.</p>

<p>One of the true oddities of Apple’s OS version numbering is that because they stuck with “10” as the leading digit of MacOS’s version numbering from Mac OS X 10.0 “Cheetah”<sup id="fnr1-2025-05-28"><a href="#fn1-2025-05-28">1</a></sup> (2001) through MacOS 10.15 “Catalina” (2019), before finally turning the dial to 11 with MacOS 11 “Big Sur” (2020), a casual observer would presume that iOS (currently at 18.5) is older than MacOS (currently at 15.5) when in fact it’s the other way around.</p>

<p>This was like the ultimate in wishbranding. A real cheetah is the fastest land animal on Earth. Mac OS X 10.0 “Cheetah” was the slowest-feeling OS Apple ever released.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-05-28"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

	<summary type="text">My chances of ever landing a job at The New York Times continue to sink.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The New York Times ran a really dumb Tripp Mickle piece yesterday under the headline “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/technology/apple-iphone-trump-india-china.html">Is Trump’s ‘Made in America’ iPhone a Fantasy?</a>” The answer should have simply been “<em>Yes, it’s sheer fantasy</em>”, perhaps with explanations why. Instead, Mickle twists the piece into pretzels to make it seem like the answer is <em>maybe</em>, even though there’s not a single fact to back that up. Not one. The only thing that backs up any answer other than “<em>It’s a fantasy, can’t happen, makes no sense</em>” are comments from analysts — named and unnamed — and the bizarre old-school news media practice of treating as fact any nonsense and/or bullshit that comes out of the lips of anyone with the word “analyst” on their business card.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Could Apple make iPhones in the United States?</em></p>

<p>Yes. Apple could make iPhones in the United States. But doing so
would be expensive and difficult and force the company to more
than double iPhone prices to $2,000 or more, said Wayne Lam, an
analyst with TechInsights, a market research firm. Apple would
have to buy new machines and rely on more automation than it
uses in China because the U.S. population is so much smaller,
Mr. Lam said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is nonsense. The problem isn’t that China has a higher population than the US (about 1.4 billion vs. 340 million, about a 4× difference). <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-factory-foxconn-china-photos-tour-2018-5">Foxconn employs somewhere between 300–500,000 assembly line workers in China</a> doing final assembly for Apple products. It’s that the United States doesn’t have anyone with the necessary vocational skills, who would want to work tedious factory jobs at factory-job wages, and China does. That’s part of the fever-dream mad-king fantasy of this entire cockamamie endeavor by Trump: <em>these are difficult, low-paying, long-houred jobs that Americans don’t want</em>. That these jobs are all in China and India is proof that America is far ahead, not that we’ve fallen behind. (There are nuances to the overall dynamics, like the national security ramifications of our being reliant on Taiwan for leading-edge chip fabrication, but Trump’s tariff nonsense doesn’t address those issues.)</p>

<p>Worse: $2,000 is just a made-up number. Lam doesn’t even say which iPhone would cost $2,000. Would it be the iPhone 16 Pro Max (current starting price: $1,200) or the base model iPhone 16e (current price: $600)? Mickle reports that Lam is saying prices “would more than double” so let’s just say he’s talking about the regular no-adjective iPhone models. Today the iPhone 16 starts at $800. If assembling even <em>some</em> of them would result in a retail price of $2,000, Apple would sell none of them. Like, almost literally zero.</p>

<p>The math here takes a bit of thinking but it’s not complicated. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/23/trump-cook-apple-india">Trump is claiming he’s going to apply 25% tariffs</a> to India-made iPhones sold in the US.<sup id="fnr1-2025-05-24"><a href="#fn1-2025-05-24">1</a></sup> If Apple passed along the entire 25% tariff on an $800 iPhone to consumers, that would raise the retail price to $1,000. So if stores carried two different iPhone 17 models — same specs, same colors — and one cost $1,000 because it was assembled in India or China, facing 25% Trump tariffs, and the other cost $2,000 because it was assembled in some sort of fantasy factory that somehow popped up in Texas between now and September, how many people would buy the $2,000 US-assembled one? Almost zero. So why even bother? Apple doesn’t even print the “Designed by Apple in California / Assembled in Wherever” small print on the outside of the iPhone any more.</p>

<p>Tariffs would have to be 250% for the price of an Indian- or Chinese-assembled $800 iPhone to get to $2,000. And even if Trump <em>were</em> to apply 250% tariffs to smartphones — which isn’t going to happen — it would be far easier for Apple to just sell Indian and Chinese-assembled iPhones for $2,000 than it would be to spin up assembly — factories, employees, training, components — here inside the US. So even though $2,000 is just a number “analyst” Wayne Lam completely made up, and which reporter Tripp Mickle simply quotes as if it had any basis in reality, it still doesn’t make any sense that Apple would do it. No matter how crazily high tariffs go, it only makes sense for Apple to continue assembling iPhones in China and India for now, and passing some or all of the costs along to consumers.<sup id="fnr2-2025-05-24"><a href="#fn2-2025-05-24">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Of course, raising the price of a base model iPhone to $2,000 would crater consumer demand. And of course it would create <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/trump-tariffs-smugglers/682303/">a massive gray market bootlegging opportunity</a> where hustlers would smuggle normal-cost iPhones into the US from Canada, Mexico, and overseas. Trump can’t raise the price of iPhones outside the US, and so long as iPhones are priced “normally” everywhere else in the world, the higher Trump’s tariffs might go, the larger and more commonplace bootlegging them will be.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There would be some benefits to moving the supply chain, including
reducing the environmental costs of shipping products from abroad,
said Matthew Moore, who spent nine years as a manufacturing design
manager at Apple. But the upsides would be trivial compared with
the challenges that would have to be overcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, just utter nonsense. There <em>might</em> be hypothetical environmental benefits to assembling all US-sold iPhones inside the US, but in the real world, many if not most of the most expensive components would still come from overseas. All iPhone displays come from Asian manufacturers. All A-series chips come from TSMC in Taiwan. (TSMC is building out a chip-fabrication campus in Arizona but even if that went according to plan — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/technology/apple-iphone-trump-india-china.html">which it already isn’t</a> — their Arizona fabrication capabilities will remain years behind their leading-edge fabrication technology in Taiwan for at least the next decade, and Apple’s A-series chips are fabbed exclusively on leading-edge technology.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Supply chain experts say shifting iPhone production to the United
States in 2025 would be foolish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the one accurate sentence in Mickle’s entire piece.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iPhone is nearly 20 years old. Apple’s top executives have
said people may not need an iPhone in 10 years because it could be
replaced by a new device built for artificial intelligence. As a
result, Apple would invest a lot of money that it wouldn’t be able
to recoup, Mr. Lam said.</p>

<p>“I would be surprised if there’s an iPhone 29,” he said, noting
that Apple is trying to disrupt the iPhone by making augmented
reality products like the Vision Pro.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Mac is 41 years old and, last I checked, Apple is still making them. I don’t know if Apple will keep naming iPhones with annually incrementing integers, but I’ll gladly wager Wayne Lam (or Tripp Mickle) any amount of money they wish that Apple will release at least one new iPhone in 2037. Name the wager, fellas. “The iPhone is 20 years old” is the dumbest argument in this entire dumb article.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What does China offer that the United States doesn’t?</em></p>

<p>Small hands, a massive, seasonal work force and millions of
engineers. Young Chinese women have small fingers, and that has
made them a valuable contributor to iPhone production because they
are more nimble at installing screws and other miniature parts in
the small device, supply chain experts said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, now I have to eat my own words. “Young Chinese women have small fingers” is in fact the dumbest argument in this entire incredibly stupid article. It might even be the dumbest thing I’ve read this year, and with Trump in office, I’ve read a lot of dumb things. For chrissake I just read <em>this morning</em> that <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/us-news-trump-vs-harvard-they-cant-add-22-trump-wildly-claims-harvard-students-cant-even-do-remedial-math/articleshow/121373450.cms">Trump claimed his administration is trying to revoke Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students</a> because “A lot of the people need remedial math. These students can’t add two and two, and they go to Harvard. They want remedial math and they’re going to teach remedial math at Harvard?” That’s truly profoundly stupid.<sup id="fnr3-2025-05-24"><a href="#fn3-2025-05-24">3</a></sup> But it’s not as ignorant as saying that Chinese women’s finger-size is the reason Apple makes iPhones in China.</p>

<p>I’d pay good money to know the names of the “supply chain experts” (plural!) Mickle got this one from.</p>

<li id="fn1-2025-05-24">
<p>Presumably the tariff would be applied to all India-assembled phones sold in the US, because it would be plainly illegal, even in Trumpworld, to put a tariff on the iPhone alone. Tariffs apply to classes of products, not specific brands. But, in practice, a 25% tariff on all Indian-assembled phones sold in the US would, effectively, be a tariff targeted at iPhones alone.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-05-24"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<p>Spitball idea: Apple could start assembling a completely insignificant number of iPhones in, say, Texas. A complete farce. A few hundred US-made iPhones per day, in a country where they sell 150,000 iPhones per day. Make a big show of it. Invite Trump himself down for a dog-and-pony-show photo op <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/apple-ceo-tim-cook-and-preident-trump-tour-texas-computer-factory.html">like Tim Cook did with the Mac Pro plant back in Trump 1.0</a> in 2019. Have Cook emphasize that they’re just getting started and Apple looks forward to ramping up the endeavor. Give Trump the first US-made iPhone off the assembly line. Hope that that’ll satisfy the dumb bastard, he’ll take the tariffs off their backs, and he’ll thereafter start bragging about how he got Apple to start making iPhones in the US even though everyone said it would be impossible, even though, under the scheme I’m spitballing here, Apple would only ever assemble a fraction of a single percent of US-sold iPhones domestically. Trump is so dumb, so prone to succumbing to flattery and the mere illusion that his word is others’ command, and so motivated to declare victory regardless of what’s actually going on, that I bet it would work.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2025-05-24"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Some “<em>thank god some of you remembered because I thought I was going nuts</em>” follow-up regarding my remembrance the other day, “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/05/15_years_later_very_insightful_and_not_negative">15 Years Later: ‘Very Insightful and Not Negative’</a>”. I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, what would <em>you</em> do if Steve Jobs was quoted in a viral blog
post saying, “We think «<em>Your Name Here</em>»’s post is very
insightful and not negative”? I decided to just sit there with a
smug look on my face for a few days (which, arguably, isn’t all
that different from what I do most days) and pretend that it was
no big deal. I didn’t link to it or mention it on Daring Fireball,
and as far as I can tell, <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%22not%20negative%22%20(from%3Agruber)&amp;src=typed_query">I didn’t even tweet it</a>. As best I
can recall, I thought I should just play it cool. I mean of course
my article about why Apple changed Section 3.3.1 was right. Why
brag? Given that Steve Jobs was reading Daring Fireball, I didn’t
want him to read a post from me acting like it was a big deal that
he’d recommended a piece I wrote and agreed with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>About a dozen long-time readers recalled that I <em>did</em>, in fact, acknowledge it on Daring Fireball — and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/114523770015232774">as soon as I saw</a> the first message, it all came back to me. I never linked to the viral blog post where Jobs was quoted recommending my article. I never mentioned it in a post. But I <em>did</em> acknowledge it, in what is clearly the most Daring-Fireball-ish way possible: I made it the slogan under the logo banner. That it was only ever a slogan in a PNG logo graphic explains why I couldn’t find it by searching. And I still have that version of the logo (because I keep everything):</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/05/df_logo_insightful_not_negative_2010.png"
    alt = "The 2010 DF logo with the slogan “Insightful and Not Negative” underneath in small type."
    style = "background-color: #4a525a; margin-bottom: 1em;"
  />
</div>

<p>I can’t remember if I omitted the <em>very</em> before <em>insightful</em> for aesthetic length, humility, or because I somehow thought it was punchier. But my 2025 self thinks it was a mistake to omit it. It surely looks blurry on your screen today, because it’s a 1× graphic scaled to the correct size. In April 2010, 2× retina resolution wasn’t yet a thing — remember, that was the very month that Gizmodo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkK7_QEIJrg" title="Jon Prosser’s documentary: “The Biggest Apple Leak in History”">published details regarding a stolen iPhone 4 prototype</a>, which was the device that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq8j5vsqCCo" title="Steve Jobs introducing and defining the retina display at WWDC 2010.">introduced “retina resolution” to the world</a>. At 50 percent, you can see it pixel-perfect (the slogan is rendered in <a href="https://kare.com/fonts/">Susan Kare’s exquisite Kare Five Dots</a> pixel font), but small:</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    srcset = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/05/df_logo_insightful_not_negative_2010.png 2x"
    alt = "The 2010 DF logo with the slogan “Insightful and Not Negative” underneath in small type. Rendered at half-size to remain pixel-perfect on modern 2× retina resolution displays."
    style = "background-color: #4a525a; margin-bottom: 1em;"
  />
</div>

<p>In the very early days, there was always a slogan under the DF logo. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/design/1/">Originally</a>: “Mac Punditry and Curmudgeonry”. Then, for several years, I’d mix it up, with descriptive slogans like “Mac + Web Nerdery, Etc.”, but also with ones that were just there for fun: “Now With Retsyn”, “Simple Tricks and Nonsense”, and, during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBWg93q9qBA">2008 World Series</a>, “Phillies Fever”. But for the last decade or so, I’ve left the logo banner slogan-less most weeks of the year.</p>

<p>Feels like the right time to bring back a little whimsy, so I’ve put “Very Insightful and Not Negative” back as the slogan for now, and I’m thinking I should keep occasionally having some fun up there.</p>

	<summary type="text">So, what would *you* do if Steve Jobs was quoted in a viral blog post saying, “We think «*Your Name Here*»’s post is very insightful and not negative”? I decided to just sit there with a smug look on my face for a few days.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Earlier this week Nilay Patel was working on the show notes for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/664802/apple-app-store-iphone-ios-fortnite-epic-games-lawsuit">the episode of Decoder I guested on</a>, and he texted me to ask if I could recall the time Steve Jobs sent some random developer a link to an article I wrote about the App Store. He wanted to cite it as an example of Daring Fireball being read, at high levels inside Apple, for a long time. I recalled the whole thing vaguely, as a “holy shit” moment, but not specifically. I hadn’t thought about it in years. But I was sure I could find it in the DF archives.</p>

<p>Turns out, I couldn’t find it, because, it turns out, in a fit of inexplicable modesty and humility, <em>I never linked to it</em>. (From <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/12/gruber-apple-was-right-adobe-get-over-it-video/">a TechCrunch interview I did at the time</a>, after the saga went somewhat viral: “When asked for his response to Steve’s shout-out, Gruber meekly grinned and said, ‘I just smiled.’”)</p>

<p>Here’s the rough timeline of events. On Thursday 8 April 2010, Apple updated the App Store guidelines to ban the use of Adobe’s then-new Flash-to-iPhone compiler. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/04/iphone_agreement_bans_flash_compiler">From my post on the change</a> (which, to some degree, broke the news):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prior to today’s release of the iPhone OS 4 SDK, section 3.3.1 of
the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement read, in its
entirety:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.3.1 — Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner
    prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private
    APIs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the new version of the iPhone Developer Program License
Agreement released by Apple today (and which developers must agree
to before downloading the 4.0 SDK beta), section 3.3.1 now reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.3.1 — Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner
    prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private
    APIs. Applications must be originally written in Objective-C,
    C, C++, or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit
    engine, and only code written in C, C++, and Objective-C may
    compile and directly link against the Documented APIs (e.g.,
    Applications that link to Documented APIs through an
    intermediary translation or compatibility layer or tool are
    prohibited).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My reading of this new language is that cross-compilers, such as
the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashcs5/appsfor_iphone/">Flash-to-iPhone compiler</a> in Adobe’s upcoming Flash
Professional CS5 release, are prohibited. This also bans apps
compiled using <a href="http://monotouch.net/">MonoTouch</a> — a tool that compiles C# and .NET
apps to the iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was <em>enormously</em> controversial at the time, but I also thought largely misunderstood by developers. Later that same day, I published another piece articulating my take on Apple’s reasoning for the change, “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/04/why_apple_changed_section_331">Why Apple Changed Section 3.3.1</a>”. From that article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re still in the early days of the transition from the PC era to
the mobile era. Right now, Apple is winning. There are other
winners right now too — RIM is still growing, and Android has
grown a ton in the past year.</p>

<p>The App Store platform could turn into a long-term de facto
standard platform. That’s how Microsoft became Microsoft. At a
certain point developers wrote apps for Windows because so many
users were on Windows and users bought Windows PCs because all the
software was being written for Windows. That’s the sort of
situation that creates a license to print money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems prescient. (The “license to print money” part — not the “RIM is still growing” part.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what Apple does not want is for some other company to establish
a de facto standard software platform <em>on top</em> of Cocoa Touch. Not
Adobe’s Flash. Not .NET (through MonoTouch). If that were to
happen, there’s no lock-in advantage. If, say, a mobile Flash
software platform — which encompassed multiple lower-level
platforms, running on iPhone, Android, Windows Phone 7, and
BlackBerry — were established, that app market would not give
people a reason to prefer the iPhone.</p>

<p>And, obviously, such a meta-platform would be out of Apple’s
control. Consider a world where some other company’s
cross-platform toolkit proved wildly popular. Then Apple releases
major new features to iPhone OS, and that other company’s toolkit
is slow to adopt them. At that point, it’s the <em>other</em> company
that controls when third-party apps can make use of these
features.</p>

<p>So from Apple’s perspective, changing the iPhone Developer Program
License Agreement to prohibit the use of things like Flash CS5 and
MonoTouch to create iPhone apps makes complete sense. I’m not
saying you have to like this. I’m not arguing that it’s anything
other than ruthless competitiveness. I’m not arguing (up to this
point) that it benefits anyone other than Apple itself. I’m just
arguing that it makes sense from Apple’s perspective — and it was
Apple’s decision to make.</p>

<p>Two days later, on 10 April 2010, developer Greg Slepak emailed Steve Jobs to complain about the decision, citing negative sentiment on Hacker News (much has changed since 2010, but some things have not), writing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Steve,</p>

<p>Lots of people are pissed off at Apple’s mandate that applications
be “originally written” in C/C++/Objective-C. If you go, for
example, to the Hacker News homepage right now:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">http://news.ycombinator.com/</a></p>

<p>You’ll see that most of the front page stories about this new
restriction, with #1 being: “<a href="http://whydoeseverythingsuck.com/2010/04/steve-jobs-has-just-gone-mad.html">Steve Jobs Has Just Gone Mad</a>” with
(currently) 243 upvotes. The top 5 stories are all negative
reactions to the TOS, and there are several others below them as
well. Not a single positive reaction, even from John Gruber, your
biggest fan.</p>

<p>I love your product, but your SDK TOS are growing on it like an
invisible cancer.</p>

<p>Sincerely, <br />
Greg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jobs wrote back to Slepak (starting a brief exchange of emails):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We think John Gruber’s post is very insightful and not negative:</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/why_apple_changed_section_331">http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/why_apple_changed_section_331</a></p>

<p>Steve</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.taoeffect.com/blog/2010/04/steve-jobs-response-on-section-3-3-1/">Slepak posted the exchange to his blog</a>, Tao Effect, and, well, as Jobs himself might have said, “Boom.” (This was <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/steve-jobs-what-have-you-done-thats-so-great/">a not infrequent thing</a> at the time, where random users or developers would email Jobs, he’d write back with something pithy, and they’d post the exchange. It was kind of crazy — the most famous CEO in the world, just doing customer service email — and his emails were always sharp.)</p>

<p>So, what would <em>you</em> do if Steve Jobs was quoted in a viral blog post saying, “We think «<em>Your Name Here</em>»’s post is very insightful and not negative”? I decided to just sit there with a smug look on my face for a few days (which, arguably, isn’t all that different from what I do most days) and pretend that it was no big deal. I didn’t link to it or mention it on Daring Fireball, and as far as I can tell, <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%22not%20negative%22%20(from%3Agruber)&amp;src=typed_query">I didn’t even tweet it</a>. As best I can recall, I thought I should just play it cool. I mean of course my article about why Apple changed Section 3.3.1 was right. Why brag? Given that Steve Jobs was reading Daring Fireball, I didn’t want him to read a post from me acting like it was a big deal that he’d recommended a piece I wrote and agreed with it.</p>

<p>That was pretty stupid on my part. Or at least silly. My older perspective, today, is not to overthink such things. If something cool happens, I link to it. It seems ridiculous in hindsight that I didn’t link to Slepak’s post. And, I was thinking this week, if <em>I</em> couldn’t find a link to the overall story because <em>I</em> wrongly presumed I must have linked to it at the time, I wondered how many other readers, over the years, have gone hunting for that “very insightful and not negative” story and couldn’t find it because it was never mentioned or linked to on Daring Fireball.</p>

<p>So, today, I wrote the post I should have written back then, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/04/11/very-insightful-and-not-negative">backdated it to 11 April 2010</a>.</p>

<p>To complete the timeline, April 2010 was a busy month. That same month saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/28/hp-palm-deal-webos/">HP buy Palm</a> (in a last-ditch effort to remain relevant as the industry rapidly shifted from being PC-centric to mobile-centric), <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/04/28/siri">Apple acquire a company called “Siri”</a>, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/04/28/slate-iphone">Gizmodo publish details on the iPhone 4 prototype</a> some poor Apple engineer accidentally left in a bar. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/04/the_ipad">The original iPad</a> had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100404043324/http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1976935,00.html">just shipped</a>. And at the end of the month, Jobs published “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/04/29/jobs-thoughts-on-flash">Thoughts on Flash</a>” on the Apple.com homepage. It’s kind of wild that was all in one month — scrolling down <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/04/">the monthly archive page for April 2010</a> is just <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/04/30/cabin-fever">one gem</a> after <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/04/30/thoughts-on-horses">another</a>.</p>

<p>Re-reading “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100722001052/http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">Thoughts on Flash</a>” again now, for the umpteenth time, I’ll say this: I think Steve Jobs’s post was very insightful and not negative.</p>

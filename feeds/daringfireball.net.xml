<p>Christopher Yasiejko, reporting last week for Bloomberg Law:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CBP exceeded its authority in an Aug. 1 internal advice ruling
that overturned its own January decision without notice or input
from Masimo, the medical-device maker said in a <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/MASIMOCORPORATIONvUNITEDSTATESCUSTOMSANDBORDERPROTECTIONetalDocke?doc_id=X7CR5AGJN19VIQVF66HVETLJRF">complaint</a>
filed Wednesday in the US District Court for the District of
Columbia. Masimo brought claims under the Administrative Procedure
Act and the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://rulings.cbp.gov/ruling/H351038">The CBP ruling is available here</a>. <!-- Hosted copy in /misc/ for posterity. --> As I read the CPB ruling, Apple’s argument goes something like this:</p>

<p>Masimo’s patents (the validity of which Apple disputes, but that’s neither here nor there for this ruling) cover a non-invasive device worn on the user’s body, that reads blood oxygen levels by shining light of various wavelengths through the skin, computes the reading on the device, and shows the result on device. With Apple’s workaround for watches sold in the US, the computation and the display of results occur off-device (on the paired iPhone), and thus the “redesigned” blood oxygen feature doesn’t violate Masimo’s patents.</p>

<p>The CBP’s investigation centered around whether the Masimo patents were “limiting” — which seems to mean a device that does all these things: the sensors, the computation of results, and the display of results. Masimo argued that the patents weren’t limiting, and apparently made no argument for how the import ban on Apple Watches should stand if the patents were found by CBP to be limiting. The CBP asked the International Trade Commission — the outfit that instituted the import ban — whether they considered the Masimo patents to be limiting, and the ITC responded yes, they did, that that was the entire basis of the import ban.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/MASIMOCORPORATIONvUNITEDSTATESCUSTOMSANDBORDERPROTECTIONetalDocke?doc_id=X7CR5AGJN19VIQVF66HVETLJRF">Masimo’s new complaint against the CBP</a> makes mention of Apple’s Trump-pleasing <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/">series</a> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-expands-us-supply-chain-with-500-million-usd-commitment/">of</a> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/08/apple-increases-us-commitment-to-600-billion-usd-announces-ambitious-program/">announcements</a> related to investments in US manufacturing, leaving it to the reader to insinuate the implication that there’s a quid pro quo at play with the CBP ruling. But the CBP ruling’s timeline makes clear that much of the investigation took place during the Biden administration in 2024. It reads to me like that same decision would have been made, at the same time, if Kamala Harris had won last year’s election. But that’s the problem with a pay-to-play corrupt government like Trump’s, and Tim Cook’s willingness to play along to any degree, no matter how mild. By currying favor with Trump, it now looks like any decision from the U.S. government that goes in Apple’s favor might be <em>because</em> Apple curried favored with Trump. I genuinely do not believe that’s the case here. The ITC ruling was based an interpretation of Masimo’s patents that they were limited to user-worn devices that read, compute, <em>and</em> display blood oxygen levels non-invasively, and given that U.S. Apple Watches no longer compute or display the results, they no longer violate Masimo’s patents.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>After a 25-year run, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/02/macsurfer">the website MacSurfer closed in 2020</a>. But, as brought to my attention <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/macsurfer-returns/">two weeks ago by Nick Heer</a>, MacSurfer quietly returned in June. No one seemed to notice until this month.</p>

<p>The original MacSurfer was a bit of a weird site. Content-wise it was a daily headline aggregator, with no original news or commentary. That made a lot of sense in 1995 and for a few years thereafter, when the web was new. I remember reading it somewhat regularly back then. But one never really “read” MacSurfer — you scanned it. Even the name harks back to the very early web, when, <a href="https://www.netmom.com/surfing/who-invented-surfing-the-internet">somehow</a>, the idiom “surfing the Internet” took hold. (Thus <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/surfin-safari/1442871699">leading to</a> the name “Safari” for a web browser.) But MacSurfer stopped making as much sense with the advent of RSS, when it became easy to create your own custom aggregated collection of website sources. I didn’t want to dance on MacSurfer’s grave when it closed shop in 2020, but at the time, I couldn’t believe it hadn’t closed long before.</p>

<p>The revived MacSurfer hasn’t changed the concept, so I’m not sure who will read it now either. A firehose has a purpose, but it’s not for drinking.</p>

<p>The other thing that always struck me as strange about MacSurfer is that it was anonymous. There was no credit as to who was behind it. <a href="https://macdailynews.com/">MacDailyNews</a> is similar: longstanding and anonymous, and, to a lesser degree than MacSurfer, a bit of a firehose. But MacDailyNews’s unnamed author adds commentary to his posts. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/06/11/imessage-for-android">Crackpot</a> <a href="https://macdailynews.com/tag/president-trump/">wingnut</a> commentary, oftentimes, but commentary nonetheless. Pseudonyms have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain">long</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell">storied</a> history. But I think it’s weird — and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/on_the_accountability_of_unnamed_public_relations_spokespeople#fn3-2024-12-14">somewhat suspicious</a> — not to put any name at all on your work.</p>

<p>The new MacSurfer, like the old one, remains unsigned. But after <a href="https://schwarztech.net/articles/macsurfer-is-back">Eric Schwarz started blogging about</a> the mysterious return of the site after its half-decade absence, the new owner, Ken Turner, reached out and <a href="https://schwarztech.net/articles/interview-with-macsurfers-new-owner-ken-turner">agreed to an interview</a>.</p>

<p>Supply chain leaker Majin Bu has the scoop, including photos of the cases and their packaging, of Apple’s second attempt at a fabric-based successor to leather iPhone cases. Apple’s first attempt two years ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/finewoven">FineWoven</a>, was so unpopular that they didn’t even offer a premium level of Apple-branded cases last year with the iPhones 16.</p>

<p>Apple dropped all use of leather two years ago, including watch bands and wallets. FineWoven was kind of shitty for those too — it just wasn’t a durable material, but Apple put it to use on products that demand durability. I mean that’s the entire point of an iPhone case in particular. These new TechWoven cases look good, and I doubt Apple will make the same durability mistake twice. The new cases have metal buttons (yay) but also a bottom lip on the case (boo). No word yet on whether Apple will replace FineWoven with TechWoven for <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/watch/bands/finewoven">Apple Watch bands</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MA6W4ZM/A/iphone-finewoven-wallet-with-magsafe-black">MagSafe Wallets</a> too, but I bet they will. I doubt we’ll ever hear the word “FineWoven” again.</p>

<p>(Majin Bu has <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/iphone-17-new-liquid-silicone-cases-official-colors-revealed/">leaked photos of Apple’s new silicone cases</a>, too.)</p>

<p>Tulsi Gabbard — who, believe it or not, is the US director of national intelligence — on X last week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the past few months, I’ve been working closely with our
partners in the UK, alongside @POTUS and @VP, to ensure Americans’
private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and
civil liberties are protected.</p>

<p>As a result, the UK has agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to
provide a “back door” that would have enabled access to the
protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on
our civil liberties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdj2m3rrk74o">BBC News</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The BBC understands Apple has not yet received any formal
communication from either the US or UK governments. “We do not
comment on operational matters, including confirming or denying
the existence of such notices,” a UK government spokesperson said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back in February, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/apple_pulls_advanced_data_protection_from_the_uk">Apple pulled the Advanced Data Protection feature of iCloud from the UK</a>, in what it deemed a necessary move to comply with the UK demand. Until and if Apple restores the ADP feature in the UK, I wouldn’t consider this over. I hope it’s true, but a Trump official tweeting that it’s true doesn’t make it true.</p>

<p>John McCoy, on the supposedly controversial Cracker Barrel rebranding:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But just because I doubt that these choices were motivated by
politics doesn’t mean the detractors don’t have a point: something
basic is being lost here. In both cases the companies have
discarded character and context in an effort to streamline their
identity. <a href="https://johnmccoy.org/2016/05/12/give-us-those-nice-bright-colors-give-us-the-greens-of-summer/">I have written previously</a> about the often
misguided penchant art directors have towards simplifying their
brands. I suspect that the lion’s share (ha) of this tendency is
simply following trends, and the current fashion in corporate
design is simple, flat typography and short (often single-word)
brand names. To the extent that someone actually gave this a
thought, the rationale is to remove any attributes that might
complicate a consumer’s attitude towards the brand. It also
reflects the desire of new executives to mark their territory by
peeing on it — see <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/branding-experts-max-renamed-hbo-max-1236399788/">HBO’s constant rebranding</a>, or Elon
Musk <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcuscollins/2023/07/30/the-real-lesson-to-be-learned-from-twitters-rebrand/">destroying the only part of Twitter that had any
value</a>, its name recognition.</p>

<p>If you want to be charitable, and I try to be when I can, the move
towards brand simplification also reflects a longstanding adage in
design — be it visual art, design, writing, or engineering: “less
is more.” This saying, often misattributed to Mies van der Rohe,
emphasizes clarity and utility. The goal is to focus on what is
essential. Practitioners of this belief make outsized claims about
the effects of this approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2025/08/the-relentless-drive-toward-simplified-design/">via Jason Snell at Six Colors</a>, and, on the presumption that all of you have the good sense to read Six Colors regularly, I’d let you encounter McCoy’s post there, but for my need to make a few side points, gleaned from Threads:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The “controversy” is regarding the removal of the Uncle Herschel mascot (the <a href="https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/ezbx27y">cracker</a>) and the barrel. But <a href="https://www.threads.com/@jw/post/DN0oNKqYtO_">Josh Williams argues</a> that the lettering itself is nicely done in the new mark, and I agree. But I also agree with McCoy’s larger point that minimalistic rebrandings are simply trendy and Cracker Barrel is <a href="https://x.com/paulg/status/1959366015382589502">very late to the trend</a>, which, like all trends, will surely soon reverse.</p></li>
<li><p>That it’s a controversy at all <a href="https://www.threads.com/@spleenyone/post/DNsmnCf4sfx">is the work of activist investor Sardar Biglari</a>, CEO of midwest chain Steak ’n Shake. (Biglari’s father was a general under the Shah of Iran, and the family had to flee after the revolution.) Biglari has been trying to take over Cracker Barrel, Carl Icahn corporate-raider-style, for 15 years. That’s why Steak ’n Shake has been <a href="https://x.com/SteaknShake/status/1958956619070677489">stoking the supposed controversy about Cracker Barrel on its X account</a>. And Steak ’n Shake, under Biglari’s leadership, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/1m9s3wz/whats_been_going_on_with_steak_n_shake/">has been all-in as a MAGA brand</a> whilst <a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/story/evolving-steak-n-shake-has-closed-200-locations-since-2018/">closing over 200 restaurants in the last 7 years</a>. You can like or dislike the Cracker Barrel rebranding, but it’s not “woke”. It’s just minimal. The idea that it’s “woke” is just nonsense promulgated by Biglari to get the result we’re actually seeing, where pro-Trump media outlets (like Fox News) pick up on the rebranding as somehow “woke”, Cracker Barrel gets bad publicity and their stock price suffers, and maybe Biglari gets a chance to take over the chain, which is all he cares about.</p></li>
<li><p>Last word <a href="https://www.threads.com/@dreamwieber/post/DNyPmXmUk-0">goes to Gregory Wieber</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

(<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/26/apple-event-glowtime">Last year’s event</a> went on Monday 9 September, probably because the Harris-Trump debate was already scheduled for Tuesday the 10th.)

<p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, on page 17 of her dissent in <em>National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a broader sense, however, today’s ruling is of a piece with
this Court’s recent tendencies. “[R]ight when the Judiciary
should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law’s
constraints,” the Court opts instead to make vindicating the rule
of law and preventing manifestly injurious Government action as
difficult as possible. This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a
twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules.<sup>6</sup>
We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration
always wins.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>MacOS has shipped with a collection of “utility” apps since the prehistoric era of classic Mac OS. A good rule of thumb for what makes an app a “utility” is that it’s a tool for doing something <em>about</em> your computer. Ever since Mac OS X 10.0, most of these apps have been neatly filed away in <em>/Applications/Utilities/</em>. Others — some because they’re obscure (e.g. Ticket Viewer), some because they’re effectively deprecated (e.g. DVD Player, whose copyright date in MacOS 15 Sequoia is 2019), and some because they present themselves, when launched, not as apps but as system-level features (e.g. About This Mac) — are tucked away in <em>/System/Library/CoreServices/</em> or <em>/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@BasicAppleGuy/115089810537348465">Basic Apple Guy posted a screenshot to Mastodon</a> comparing the current MacOS 15 icons for four of these utilities (Disk Utility, Expansion Slot Utility, Wireless Diagnostics, and AppleScript Utility) to their new icons in MacOS 26 Tahoe, beta 7 (click to enlarge for detail):</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/tahoe-utility-icons-via-basic-apple-guy.jpeg" class="noborder">
  <img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/tahoe-utility-icons-via-basic-apple-guy.jpeg"
    alt = "Screenshots of the MacOS 15 and MacOS 26 (beta 7) icons for Disk Utility, Expansion Slot Utility, Wireless Diagnostics, and AppleScript Utility."
    width = 500
  /></a></p>

<p>I don’t think the old icons for these apps from MacOS 15 were particularly good — Apple has mostly lost its “<a href="https://mastodon.social/@BasicAppleGuy/115050148901528749">icons</a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@BasicAppleGuy/115072885331562510">look</a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@BasicAppleGuy/114948306713250918">cool</a>” game. But the new ones in MacOS 26 Tahoe are objectively terrible. The only one of this bunch that’s maybe sort of OK is Wireless Diagnostics. They all look like placeholder icons made by a developer who would be the first to admit that they’re not an artist. Disk Utility, which is an important app, doesn’t even look like it involves a disk.</p>

<p>These new icons all use the same “wrench” motif, which is a lazy, limiting concept to start with. Tahoe, at the system level, enforces a squircle shape on all application icons. Apps that haven’t been updated with Tahoe-compliant everything-fits-in-a-squircle icons are put in “<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/08/macos-tahoe-fix-gray-box-icons/">squircle jail</a>” — their non-Tahoe-compliant icons are shrunk and placed atop a drab gray Tahoe squircle background, to force them into squircle compliance. But these Apple utility apps have an entire sub-motif — inside their base squircle shape is a large wrench fitted against a bolt. Only inside the bolt — which is inside the wrench’s jaws, which wrench is inside the squircle — goes the part of the icon that identifies the app itself. So maybe like 10 percent of the area of the icon is the area where the app can show something that identifies its purpose.</p>

<p>So the entire concept for these icons sucks. But the conceptual execution sucks too. The wrench is incredibly stupid-looking. Whoever drew it has obviously never used an open-end wrench because the jaws on the wrench head are <em>way</em> too thin. They’d break off under any significant torque. Just look at a photo of real-life wrench, or just <a href="https://mastodon.social/@BasicAppleGuy/115092733884236020">look at the wrench heads in the older MacOS icons</a> (or Apple’s 🔧 emoji, for that matter).</p>

<p>Individually the icons mostly suck too:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Disk Utility — a very important app — has an icon that’s just an Apple logo (inside the bolt that’s inside the wrench that’s inside the squircle). Not a hard disk, not an external drive, not an SD card. Just an Apple logo. If I just showed you this icon without telling you which app it represented, how in the world would you guess what it is? Even if you know the “Apple utility app icon” motif of the big dumb wrench and bolt, the best you could guess is “a utility app for something Apple-related” which, for an Apple computer, could be anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Expansion Slot Utility — This app only runs on Mac Pros because Mac Pros are the only Macs with expansion slots. So the old icon naturally shows a Mac Pro. The new icon shows ... three rectangular empty sockets?</p></li>
<li><p>AppleScript Utility — A fine concept for this icon (within the confines of the terrible wrench-and-bolt utility icon concept). Everyone who knows AppleScript knows the scroll that represents AppleScript scripts. So just put the iconic AppleScript scroll in the bolt in the wrench in the squircle. But here, the placement of the scroll is botched — it’s rotated a few degrees counterclockwise. It makes the scroll look like it’s falling over. Here’s how the scroll is canonically oriented, via the glyphs in SF Symbols:</p>

<p><img
  src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/applescript-icons-sf-symbols.png"
  alt = "The “applescript” and “applescript.fill” icon glyphs from the SF Symbols font."
/></p>

<p>and via the default icon for a script application (with a line added showing the center):</p>

<p><img
  src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/macos-15-script-application-icon.png"
  alt = "The default application for an AppleScript “script application”, with a vertical orange line showing the center."
  width = 440
/></p>

<p>But here’s a close-up of the Tahoe AppleScript Utility icon, with a center line added:</p>

<p><img
  src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/tahoe-applescript-utility-icon-drunk.png"
  alt = "Close-up of the MacOS 26 Tahoe icon for AppleScript Utility, with a center line added to show that the script “scroll” is tilted incorrectly."
/></p>

<p>It’s wrong.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are the not the work of carpenters <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/445621-when-you-re-a-carpenter-making-a-beautiful-chest-of-drawers">who care about the backs of the cabinets</a> they’re building. These icons are so bad, they look like the work of untrained “How hard can it be?” dilettante carpenters who only last a few days on the job before sawing off one of their own fingers. The whole collection looks like the work from someone with no artistic ability <em>nor</em> an eye for detail. From <em>Apple</em>, of all companies.</p>

<p>Is it a big deal in the grand scheme of things that the icons for these seldom-used utility apps have gone to shit? No. But consider the proverbial canary in a coal mine. The problem isn’t that one little bird has died. The problem is that the bird might be dead because the whole mine is filling with deadly carbon monoxide or highly flammable methane gas. The icons in <em>/Applications/Utilities/</em> in MacOS 26 Tahoe represent a folder full of dead canaries. </p>

<p>Benjamin Mayo, 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced that the monthly price of Apple TV+ is
rising in the United States and some international markets. From
today, the monthly subscription will cost $12.99, up from $9.99.</p>

<p>Existing subscribers will see the price change 30 days after the
next renewal date. The pricing for yearly TV+ subscriptions and
the Apple One services bundle remains unchanged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The annual price for a standalone TV+ subscription — unchanged, as Mayo reports — remains $99. The usual rule-of-thumb for subscriptions of any sort seems to be to charge 10× the monthly rate for an annual subscription. That’s exactly where the TV+ month/annual prices were before today. Now, the annual subscription price isn’t just a little bit cheaper than 12× the monthly price ($156), but a <em>lot</em> cheaper.</p>

<p>This seems to be a clear sign that streaming services are different than most subscriptions. People subscribe to newspapers or blog/newsletters and they stay subscribed, because they want to read regularly. Same for a music subscription, like Spotify or Apple Music — people want to listen to music all the time. Churn is just naturally higher with streaming video — people subscription hop. Subscribe, catch up on all the exclusive content you’ve missed, then unsubscribe. Subscribe again when there are a few more exclusive shows you’ve missed again. Unsubscribe again. And Apple TV+ <a href="https://churnkey.co/blog/churn-rates-for-streaming-services/">has been reported to have higher than average churn</a>. So I think today’s price hike, affecting only the monthly price, is about dealing with that. If you want to subscription hop, Apple TV+ is going to cost a bit more. If you want to stay subscribed to Apple TV+, you really ought to subscribe annually (or subscribe to Apple One and get Music, Arcade, and additional iCloud storage bundled together).</p>

<p>Fox (capitalization verbatim):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fox Corporation today announced the official launch of FOX One, a
bold new streaming service that brings together the full portfolio
of FOX’s News, Sports and Entertainment branded content — all in
one place, both live and on demand.</p>

<p>Available today across major web, mobile and connected TV
platforms, FOX One is priced at $19.99/month with a 7-day free
trial or $199.99/year, with the option to add-on B1G+ or bundle
FOX Nation for an even greater value. Starting October 2,
customers will also have the opportunity to bundle FOX One with
ESPN DTC Unlimited for $39.99/month.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just mentioned yesterday, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/msnbc_ms_now_rebranding">re: MS NOW’s idiotic backronym</a>, that Fox often styles its name in all caps without pretending the f-o-x letters stand for anything. Anyway, $20/month seems steep, but Fox carries <em>a lot</em> of sports.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1828048872">Apple is promoting the launch prominently in the App Store</a> (including Fox’s preferred all-caps styling), no doubt because Fox — unlike <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/disney-and-apple-are-breaking-up-over-app-store-fees/ar-AA1sJlmU">certain</a> <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum">well-established</a> streaming services — offers its subscriptions via IAP.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Sean Hollister, reporting for The Verge back in February:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/meta/603674/meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-sales">we exclusively reported Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s
remarks</a> on how many pairs of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses
the company had recently sold and might theoretically sell: 1
million pairs in 2024, with the possibility of reaching 2 million
or even 5 million by the end of 2025.</p>

<p>But glasses giant EssilorLuxottica, which produces those glasses
for Meta, has now publicly revealed 2 million pairs of Meta
Ray-Bans have sold since their October 2023 debut, and that it’s
aiming to produce 10 million Meta glasses <em>each</em> year by the end
of 2026.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/18/bezos-numbers-smart-glasses-counterpoint">I mocked a report from Counterpoint Research</a> this week for its Bezos Numbers on smart glasses sales growth. Here are some real numbers from the current market leader. For context, Steve Jobs’s stated goal for the iPhone, at launch in mid-2007, was 10 million iPhones sold by the end of 2008 — a goal they reached <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/10/apple-officially-surpasses-10-million-iphones-sold-in-2008/">before the holiday quarter of 2008 even started</a>.</p>

<p>I feel close to certain that smart glasses are going to be a big product category. But they’re not there yet. A few million units is something, but it’s not a hit. Given the current capabilities — a camera on your face, speakers on the temples, and a microphone for talking to the system — I don’t see how they currently beat a smartphone and wireless earbuds. If you already carry a phone and earbuds everywhere you go, when would you want Meta Glasses? For taking lower-quality photos and videos, and listening to lower-quality audio? I don’t think the product category is going to take off until there’s a visual HUD in the lenses, and that still seems years away, at any price.</p>

  <p>Historical pedantry: from 1975–1979, <a href="https://logos.fandom.com/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft spelled its name “Micro-Soft”</a>, with, yes, an uppercase <em>S</em>.

	<summary type="text">The oddest part about the whole situation is that CNBC is being spun out into Versant, too, but while they’re losing the NBC peacock logo, they’re just keeping their name, unchanged.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/08/18/msnbc-rebrand-ms-now-versant">Sara Fischer, Axios</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MSNBC, the progressive cable network owned by NBCUniversal, is
rebranding to MS NOW, an acronym that stands for My Source for
News, Opinion and the World.</p>

<p>The rebrand is part of a wider effort by NBCU to create a
distinction between the cable networks it plans to spin out and
the remaining NBCU parent company. As part of the rebrand, select
cable networks that will be spun out into <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/10/all-eyes-on-versant-media-trends">Versant</a>, including
CNBC, Golf Channel, GolfNow, MSNBC and SportsEngine, will all
drop the iconic peacock logo that has for decades served as
NBCU’s logo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a lot to unpack here. First, “Versant” itself is a pretty bad name (feels so vague — seems like the name of a fake company in a movie or TV show) so it’s no surprise that the same nitwits are botching Versant’s rebranded properties. But given that NBCUniversal is apparently forcing MSNBC to take the “NBC” out of its name, “MSNOW” isn’t a bad new name. But it’s not a <em>good</em> new name either. And they’re apparently using a space: “MS NOW”, yet <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/msnbc-new-name-ms-now-1236491621/">also seem confused</a> (or haven’t even decided yet) whether it’s supposed to be pronounced letter-by-letter (<em>em ess en bee see</em>) or as two letters and a word (<em>em ess now</em>). Saying the “NOW” as the word <em>now</em> makes sense for a 24/7 channel, but if it’s a word, the whole name should be styled “MS Now”. (Fox News styles their name as “FOX News” in some places, but never pretends the f-o-x is an acronym.)</p>

<p>The “My Source News Opinion World” backronym is so dumb it boggles the mind. I genuinely wonder if someone had ChatGPT do that. You can have a series of letters as a name — especially as a TV channel — without those letters really standing for anything. CNN is technically an acronym for “Cable News Network” but they’ve effectively just been “CNN” for decades now. The name “MSNBC” came from the fact that, at launch in the 1990s, <a href="https://www.threads.com/@mossbergwalt/post/DNipvTJt4HW">it debuted as a collaboration</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_MSNBC:_1996–2007">between Microsoft’s MSN and NBC News</a>. But Microsoft hasn’t been involved with the cable channel <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-dec-24-fi-msnbc24-story.html">for 20 years</a> — the “MS” in “MSNBC” hasn’t stood for anything since 2005. (In fact, MSN itself is another good example. It originally stood for “Microsoft Network”, even though Microsoft has never styled their name with a camel-cased <em>S</em>.<sup id="fnr1-2025-08-20"><a href="#fn1-2025-08-20">1</a></sup> But it’s really just “MSN” now.)<sup id="fnr2-2025-08-20"><a href="#fn2-2025-08-20">2</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://www.threads.com/@tomgara/post/DNgNQeQOlIB">Tom Gara, writing on Threads</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only real fuck up with the MSNBC rebrand is that they made up
a dumb sounding fake acronym. It’s completely unnecessary! Just
say “we’re changing our name to MS NOW to reflect the urgency of
the moment.” Nobody has ever thought about what the old acronym
stood for and nobody needed a new fake one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There <em>is</em> another fuck up, though: the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/msnow.png">logo</a> is atrocious. What is that flag? It looks like the Austrian flag (🇦🇹), not America’s. But are we sure it even <em>is</em> a flag? Maybe it’s a paper receipt and the red stripes are those marks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DollarGeneral/comments/p7sl4t/why_does_the_printer_do_the_pink_streak_near_the/">when it’s time to replace the roll</a>? <a href="https://www.threads.com/@jonathanhoefler/post/DNk64Vxgah-">Jonathan Hoefler, on Threads</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My personal benchmark for a logo is that it shouldn’t look like a
pension fund.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The oddest part about the whole situation is that CNBC is being spun out into Versant, too, but while they’re losing the NBC peacock logo, they’re just keeping their name, unchanged. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/comcast-versant-rename-msnbc-peacock-logos.html">From CNBC’s own coverage of MSNBC’s rebranding</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While MSNBC and NBC News will have duplications in coverage,
CNBC’s news organization is already separate enough from NBC News
that executives decided it didn’t need a name change. Also,
technically, the “NBC” in “CNBC” never stemmed from National
Broadcasting Co. Rather, CNBC stands for “Consumer News and
Business Channel.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lastly, shoutout to M.G. Siegler for <a href="https://spyglass.org/ms-now-msnbc/">coining the term <em>peacockblocked</em></a> to describe MSNBC’s branding plight.</p>

<p>If I’d been in the room, my spitball idea for a new name would have been MNC. Take out every other letter to break both the NBC <em>and</em> Microsoft connotations, but leave behind an acronym that looks and sounds like a tighter, more efficient version of MSNBC. If they really insisted that the acronym stand for something, it could be Modern (or Major?) News Channel.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2025-08-20"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<p>Kieran Healy on, just now — amidst all <em>this</em> — becoming an American citizen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I sat down to write something about becoming a citizen, I was immediately tangled up in a skein of questions about the character of citizenship, the politics of immigration, and the relationship of individuals to the state. These have all been in the news recently; perhaps you have heard about it. These questions ask how polities work, how they impose themselves upon us, how power is exercised. They are tied up with deep-rooted principles, claims and myths — as you please — about where authority comes from and how it is or whether it ever has been justly applied. These are not easy matters to understand in principle or resolve in practice. Nor can they simply be dismissed. But I am not writing this note because I want to take on these questions, even though I acknowledge them. I am writing this because I do not want to forget how I felt yesterday.</p>

	<summary type="text">Long story short: there’s an “iPhone” menu under “Widgets” in System Settings → Desktop &amp; Dock.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I’ve been using two iPhones throughout the summer — one running iOS 18, the other running iOS 26 betas. I found myself wanting to switch between them with iPhone Mirroring on my Mac, but couldn’t figure out how. The answer, from Apple Support, “<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120421">iPhone Mirroring: Use your iPhone from your Mac</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have more than one iPhone that is both signed in to your
Apple Account and nearby, you can choose the one that your Mac
uses for mirroring and iPhone notifications:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Choose Apple menu  > System Settings, then click Desktop &amp;
Dock in the sidebar.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose your iPhone from the iPhone pop-up menu on the right.
This menu appears just below the “Use iPhone widgets” setting.
It appears only when your Mac detects more than one nearby
iPhone that can be used for mirroring.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>That pop-up menu is about halfway down the screen in Desktop &amp; Dock, in the “Widgets” section.<sup id="fnr1-2025-08-19"><a href="#fn1-2025-08-19">1</a></sup> I suspected this was possible, but I had to search the web (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/try_switching_to_kagi">via Kagi</a>, the best search engine in the world, of course) to find the answer. I never would have thought to look in System Settings → Desktop &amp; Dock, let alone, even if I happened to look in that panel, all the way down under “Widgets”.</p>

<p>Places where I <em>did</em> look:</p>

<ul>
<li>On the Mac, in the iPhone Mirroring app’s own Settings window. Nope.</li>
<li>On the iPhone, in Settings → General → Airplay &amp; Continuity. This is where you can control which Mac or Macs your iPhone is available from with iPhone Mirroring (e.g. you can go here to revoke access from a certain Mac), but it doesn’t help you change which iPhone, among multiple, that any particular Mac connects to.</li>
</ul>

<p>To Apple’s credit, searching for “mirroring” in MacOS System Settings <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/macos-18.6-settings-desktop-dock.png">does lead you to the correct setting</a>, but because it’s under “Widget settings”, I suspect some people who search for “mirroring” here will see that in the results list and not even bother clicking it, because “Widget settings” at first doesn’t sound like where you should go to choose between multiple phones for iPhone Mirroring. (It kind of makes sense, when you realize that the same iPhone that provides widgets to your Mac is the one available for iPhone Mirroring to connect to.)</p>

<p>To Apple’s discredit, Siri is no help, despite Apple Intelligence’s supposed <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/26/this-is-every-apple-intelligence-feature-thats-available-now/">ability to harness “product knowledge”</a> from LLM training on Apple’s own support documents. After asking Siri, “How do I use multiple iPhones with iPhone mirroring?” on either a Mac or iPhone, I get a brief answer that says “You can set up more than one iPhone to use iPhone Mirroring with your Mac, but you can only connect to one iPhone at a time”, with a link to the iPhone User Guide that opens in the Tips app. That page in the iPhone User Guide, however — also available on the web as “<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-your-iphone-from-your-mac-mchl444d53a6/mac">Control Your iPhone From Your Mac</a>” — doesn’t contain any mention of using more than one iPhone with iPhone Mirroring. So <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120421">this Apple Support document</a> on iPhone Mirroring does explain it (that’s the one I linked to at the top of this post), but <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-your-iphone-from-your-mac-mchl444d53a6/mac">this one does not</a>. No wonder Apple Intelligence’s “product knowledge”, trained on these documents, is somewhat confused.</p>

<p>But it gets worse. I gave Siri a second chance on my Mac, asking the same question, something along the lines of “How do I use multiple iPhones with iPhone mirroring?” (I can’t be sure exactly which words I used because Siri doesn’t show a chat transcript<sup id="fnr2-2025-08-19"><a href="#fn2-2025-08-19">2</a></sup>), and the second time, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/siri-mirroring-nonsense.png">it responded thus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To use multiple iPhones with iPhone Mirroring:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the iPhone Mirroring app on your Mac.</li>
<li>Click the “Connect” button.</li>
<li>Enter your iPhone passcode and choose how to authenticate.</li>
<li>Select the iPhone you want to use from the list of available
iPhones.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This answer certainly describes one possible way that using multiple iPhones with iPhone Mirroring <em>should</em> work, but as an answer for how it actually <em>does</em> work, it’s abject nonsense. There is no “list of available iPhones” in the iPhone Mirroring app. If there were such a list to choose from, I’d never have had a question about this whole fucking thing in the first place.</p>

<p>The first time I looked in the Desktop & Dock panel in System Settings, there was no “iPhone” pop-up menu visible, despite the fact that both of my active iPhones were on my desk, right next to my MacBook Pro. But I remembered that in the last few days, I’d been having problems with <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102430">Continuity’s Universal Clipboard</a> feature too. In the past, when Universal Clipboard has gone on the fritz, I’ve solved the problem by toggling Bluetooth off and back on. I toggled Bluetooth on my Mac and boom, the “iPhone” menu appeared in the Desktop & Dock panel in System Settings, with the pop-up menu correctly listing both of my active iPhones. Universal Clipboard started working correctly again too. I bet the <em>next</em> version of Bluetooth is actually going to be reliable.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2025-08-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<p>Counterpoint Research, in a report titled “Global Smart Glasses Shipments Soared 110 Percent YoY in H1 2025, With Meta Capturing Over 70 Percent Share”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The global smart glasses market grew by 110% YoY in H1 2025,
fueled by robust demand for Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and the
entry of new players such as Xiaomi and TCL-RayNeo.</p>

<p>Meta’s share of the global smart glasses market rose to 73% in H1
2025, driven by strong demand and expanded manufacturing capacity
at Luxottica, its key production partner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not a single absolute sales number in the whole report, not even estimated. Just percentages. Pure Bezos Numbers — which is not quite the same thing as a <a href="https://x.com/jsnell/status/481863414180896769">Bezos Chart</a>, which has no numbers at all. How do you compute percentage change without the underlying numbers? What goes unsaid is that surely any reasonable estimate of “smart glasses” sales numbers is tiny. If you go from 1 to 2 that’s 100 percent growth!</p>

	<summary type="text">A perfect logo, from a designer with a long and storied career.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/joe-caroff-dead-designer-james-bond-007-logo-1236346509/">Mike Barnes, The Hollywood Reporter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For his first movie job — he would work on more than 300
campaigns during his career — United Artists executive David
Chasman hired him to design the poster for <em>West Side Story</em>
(1961), then asked him to come up with the letterhead for a
publicity release tied to the first Bond film, <em>Dr. No</em>. (Chasman
had designed the poster for the 1962 movie.)</p>

<p>“He said, ‘I need a little decorative thing on top,’” Caroff
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A76NPoZRY8c">recalled</a> in 2021. “I knew [Bond’s] designation was 007,
and when I wrote the stem of the seven, I thought, ‘That looks
like the handle of a gun to me.’ It was very spontaneous, no
effort, it was an instant piece of creativity.”</p>

<p>Inspired by Ian Fleming’s favorite gun, a Walther PPK, Caroff
attached a barrel and trigger to the 007 and for his work received
$300, the going rate for such an assignment, he said. Even though
the logo, though altered in subtle ways, has been featured on
every Bond film and on millions of pieces of merchandise, he
received no credit, no residuals, no royalties.</p>

<p>The logo did, however, bring him “a lot of business,” he said. “It
was like a little publicity piece for me.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s rare for a logomark to have such staying power. Just <a href="https://www.designweek.co.uk/tributes-paid-to-the-james-bond-007-logo-designer-joe-caroff/">a perfect logo</a>. Kind of wild that it was created, initially, only as letterhead for stationery. Perusing vintage movie posters, it seems like EON didn’t really lean into using the logo consistently until <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/007-on-her-majestys-secret-service.jpeg"><em>On Her Majesty’s Secret Service</em></a> (1969) — the sixth film, and the first without Sean Connery. EON had used the mark prior to that (including at least <a href="https://posteritati.com/poster/8500/dr-no-1962-us-one-sheet-poster">one excellent poster for <em>Dr. No</em></a>), but it didn’t appear on most of the posters for Connery’s initial run in the role: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/007-from-russia-with-love.jpeg"><em>From Russia With Love</em></a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/007-goldfinger.jpeg"><em>Goldfinger</em></a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/007-thunderball.jpeg"><em>Thunderball</em></a>, and <em>You Only Live Twice</em> (variations <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/007-you-only-live-twice-A.jpeg">A</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/007-you-only-live-twice-B.jpeg">B</a>). Amongst those, the logo only appears on the <em>Goldfinger</em> poster. They used to make multiple posters for every movie back then, so there might exist examples for all of them with the logo. But I think until <em>On Her Majesty’s Secret Service</em>, EON leaned on Connery’s face as the symbol of the franchise. From that point forward, though, Caroff’s 007-cum-gun logo was the symbol of the franchise.<sup id="fnr1-2025-08-18"><a href="#fn1-2025-08-18">1</a></sup> I can’t seem to find an official movie poster after <em>OHMSS</em> that doesn’t feature it.</p>

<p>I will quibble with one detail from The Hollywood Reporter description above: the gun in Caroff’s original 007 mark clearly looked like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luger_pistol">Luger</a>, a rather distinctive German pistol with a long skinny barrel, not the more compact Walther PPK that Bond actually carried. Variations of the Luger-esque logo appear on the posters for all seven of the movies starring Roger Moore. EON updated the logomark to resemble a Walther PPK <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/007-the-living-daylights.jpeg">for <em>The Living Daylights</em></a> in 1987, the first (and better) of two Bond movies starring Timothy Dalton. As a kid it always bothered me — ever so slightly — that the logo resembled a gun that James Bond never actually used, but until today, researching this post, I never noticed that they addressed that in 1987. That said, I think the Luger-esque mark was a bit cooler. As a kid, that was my assumption: that “they” made it look like a Luger, not the sort of pistol Bond actually carried, because it looked cooler that way. I accepted that.</p>

<hr />

<p>Caroff had a remarkably accomplished career. <a href="https://posteritati.com/unfolding/by-design-the-joe-caroff-story">He created iconic posters for dozens of terrific films</a> across a slew of genres. The fact that he created the 007 logo but only earned $300 from it is more like a curious footnote than anything.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/17/obituaries/joe-caroff-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=1.fE8.pObu.ZW1jiWahs32T&amp;smid=url-share">Jeré Longman’s excellent obituary for The New York Times</a> (gift link), after observing that Caroff died just one day short of his 104th birthday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Caroff’s designs were familiar, but his name was not. He did
not sign much of his work and largely avoided self-promotion. He
was not included among the more than 60 celebrated designers,
among them like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/27/movies/saul-bass-75-designer-dies-made-art-out-of-movie-titles.html">Saul Bass</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/17/nyregion/leo-lionni-89-dies-versatile-creator-of-children-s-books.html">Leo Lionni</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/28/arts/paul-rand-82-creator-of-sleek-graphic-designs-dies.html">Paul
Rand</a>, in the 2017 book <a href="https://themodernsbook.com/"><em>The Moderns: Midcentury American
Graphic Design</em></a>, written by Steven Heller and Greg
D’Onofrio.</p>

<p>“That he was unknown is shocking,” Mr. Heller, co-chairman
emeritus of the Master of Fine Arts Design program at the School
of Visual Arts in Manhattan, said in a recent interview.</p>

<p>Still, Mr. Caroff’s abundant output became widely recognizable for
an interpretive style that could be bold, elegant, theatrical,
whimsical, sensual and deceptively simple in promoting a book or
movie and conveying its essence with a single image.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No better example of that reduced-to-its-essence genius than his 007 logo:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I knew that 007 meant license to kill; that, I think, at an
unconscious level, was the reason I knew the gun had to be in the
logo,” Mr. Caroff said in a 2022 documentary, <a href="https://www.hbomax.com/movies/by-design-the-joe-caroff-story/63f45e42-315c-469d-a0d4-501989f339eb"><em>By Design: The Joe
Caroff Story</em></a>.</p>

<p>Mark Cerulli, who directed the documentary, said in an interview
that the logo was a “marvel of simplicity that telegraphs
everything you would want to know about 007.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My thanks to Dekáf Coffee Roasters for sponsoring last week at DF. Dekáf believes that people who drink coffee for its flavor are the true connoisseurs. While other roasters treat decaf as a side project, they’ve made it their entire mission. They’re dedicated to creating exceptional decaffeinated coffee that stands toe-to-toe with the world’s finest caffeinated beans.</p>

<p>I drink coffee every single day. I literally can’t remember the last day I didn’t have coffee in the morning. A few years ago, though, age started catching up to me and I stopped drinking coffee after lunch or so, lest it screw with my sleep. I really missed my afternoon coffee though. Why I didn’t think to try decaf I don’t know, but Dekáf sent me a few samples when they first sponsored DF back in April, and it’s been a revelation. In addition to fully decaffeinated roasts, they also have some half-decaffeinated roasts, and they’re absolutely delicious — my style of roast, for sure — <em>and</em> they don’t leave me jolted into the evening. Maybe you like tea, but I don’t. I like coffee, and I love being able to have a cup or two late in the afternoon again. It’s so good.</p>

<p>Also, I’m a big believer that you <em>can</em> judge a book by its cover. Just look at the Dekáf brand. It’s perfect. Color, typography, artwork — so cool, so spot-on for what they do.</p>

<p>Dekáf offers 9 single origins, 6 signature blends, and 4 Mizudashi cold brews (perfect for summer). All shipped to you within 24 hours of roasting. No shortcuts. You won’t believe it’s decaf. That’s the point. Even better, get 20% off with code: <strong>DF</strong>.</p>

<p>Steve Wozniak turned 75 (!) and was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/steve-wozniak-on-fighting-internet-scams/">profiled by John Blackstone for CBS News</a> (also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLpmjXRQf6k">posted to YouTube</a>). <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/08/10/1938248/its-steve-wozniaks-75th-birthday-whatever-happened-to-his-youtube-lawsuit">Slashdot linked to it</a>, and in the comments, someone gently jabbed at Woz for having sold, rather than hoarded, his stock in Apple. Woz himself chimed in, with this comment for the ages:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I gave all my Apple wealth away because wealth and power are not
what I live for. I have a lot of fun and happiness. I funded a lot
of important museums and arts groups in San Jose, the city of my
birth, and they named a street after me for being good. I now
speak publicly and have risen to the top. I have no idea how much
I have but after speaking for 20 years it might be $10M plus a
couple of homes. I never look for any type of tax dodge. I earn
money from my labor and pay something like 55% combined tax on it.
I am the happiest person ever. Life to me was never about
accomplishment, but about Happiness, which is Smiles minus Frowns.
I developed these philosophies when I was 18-20 years old and I
never sold out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple never would have existed without Woz, and Woz personified “insanely great” engineering. He never contributed anything technical to Apple after the Apple II in the early 1980s, but, man, so much of his spirit and personality is infused in Apple’s DNA. He’s a hero to so many people who went on to work at Apple, and to so many of us on the outside too. The two Steves were so very different in so many ways, yet at heart, both exemplified that intersection between technology and the liberal arts.</p>

<p>His little comment above describing his philosophy on life brought to mind one of my favorite Woz stories, from Michael Moritz’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/littlekingdompri00mori">long-out-of-print</a> 1984 book <em>The Little Kingdom: The Private Story of Apple Computer</em>, pp. 281–282:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wozniak, who seemed determined to follow Samuel Johnson’s advice
that it was better to live rich than to die rich, was always
louder, splashier, and more cavalier about his fortune. As a
student and an engineer he had always managed his financial
affairs haphazardly and nothing changed as he grew wealthy. He
could never keep track of receipts, for months didn’t bother to
seek financial advice, and made a habit of filing his tax returns
late. Wozniak turned into an approachable teddy bear and a soft
touch. When friends, acquaintances, or strangers asked him for a
loan he often wrote out a check on the spot.</p>

<p>Unlike Jobs, who guarded his founder’s stock carefully, Wozniak
distributed some of his. He gave stock worth $4 million to his
parents, sister, and brother and $2 million to friends. He made
some investments in start-up companies. He bought a Porsche and
fastened the license plates <span class="caps">APPLE II</span> to
the car. His father found $250,000 worth of uncashed checks strewn
about the car and said of his son, “A person like him shouldn’t
have that much money.” After Wozniak finally did arrange for some
financial advice, he arrived at Apple one day to announce, “My
lawyer said to diversify so I just bought a movie theater.” Even
that turned into a complicated venture. The theater, located among
the barrios on the east side of San Jose, provoked angry community
protests after it screened a gang movie, <em>The Warriors</em>. Wozniak
attended a few community meetings, listened to the concerns of the
local leaders, promised that his theater wouldn’t show violent or
pornographic movies, and accompanied by Wigginton, spent a few
afternoons in the empty, darkened theater screening movies and
playing censor.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jason Lalljee, reporting for Axios Tuesday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Trump’s nomination of Heritage Foundation economist E.J.
Antoni to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday drew
criticism from economists across the political spectrum. <em>Why it
matters</em>: The growing negative consensus among conservative
economists is unusual given Antoni’s own conservative pedigree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we go with “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/11/unusual-agreements">unusual</a>” as a euphemism for “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/11/quid-pro-quo-financial-times">unprecedented</a>” — or perhaps, most accurately, “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/11/mad-king-watch-intel">crazy</a>” — again. The dichotomy here is that Trump and MAGA have flipped what “conservative” means in US politics. Some legitimate economists are left-leaning, some are right-leaning. It’s a field of study, like the law, that attracts from across the political spectrum. But all legitimate economists believe in trying to objectively measure the economy. MAGA kooks have overrun Republican elected politics, but not so with economics. So of course legitimate conservative economists are objecting to Trump’s nomination of <a href="https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd">this guy Antoni</a>, who both is a crackpot kook <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/11/30/the-paranoid-style">of the paranoid style</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/ej-antoni.jpeg">looks like one</a>, with crazy eyes and, of all things, a devil beard.</p>

<p>To the commentary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Antoni’s “work at Heritage has frequently included elementary
errors or nonsensical choices that all bias his findings in the
same partisan direction,” Stan Veuger, a senior fellow at the
conservative American Enterprise Institute, told Axios’ Courtenay
Brown and Emily Peck.</p>

<p>Dave Hebert, an economist at the conservative American Institute
for Economic Research, <a href="https://x.com/dave_hebert/status/1955054062325444659?s=42">wrote in a post on X</a> that he’s
worked with Antoni before and implored the Senate to block the
nomination. “I’ve been on several programs with him at this point
and have been impressed by two things: his inability to
understand basic economics and the speed with which he’s gone
MAGA,” Hebert said. [...]</p>

<p>Jessica Riedl, a senior Manhattan Institute fellow, shared another
example from X, in which Antoni appeared not to know that the BLS’
measure of import prices did not account for the impact of
tariffs. “The articles and tweets I’ve seen him publish are
probably the most error-filled of any think tank economist right
now,” she <a href="https://x.com/jessicabriedl/status/1955044169598242849?s=42">wrote</a>. “I hope we see better at BLS.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s the take on Antoni from <em>conservative</em> economists.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Emma Roth, reporting for The Verge back on July 1 (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Threads’ DMs are currently available to users aged 18 and over on
Android, iOS, <em>and the web</em>, but you can only have one-on-one
conversations right now. Moving forward, Threads plans to roll out
the ability to choose who can send you messages, including people
who don’t follow you on Threads and Instagram. You’ll also be able
to review a folder dedicated to message requests, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/2/23053114/twitter-direct-messages-dm-request-filter-secret-inbox-til">similar to
what’s offered on X</a>. Threads is working on a group messaging
feature and inbox filters, too.</p>

<p>Though the platform says its DMs are “protected by our robust
privacy standards, account protections and safety infrastructure,”
Threads spokesperson Alec Booker confirmed to The Verge that
“Threads will not support end-to-end encryption for messaging.”
Booker adds that Meta will “continue evolving DMs on Threads based
on feedback from the community.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The lack of E2EE for a new messaging platform in 2025 is unconscionable. Either don’t offer DMs at all or only offer them using E2EE. That would be for Meta’s benefit, not just its users. They shouldn’t even want the ability to look at private messages.</p>

<p>That said, I found myself chatting with an old friend on Threads last night, using the app on my phone. Somehow we’d never exchanged iMessage credentials. We more or less just used the Threads DM chat to exchange current phone numbers to move the chat to iMessage. Today, at my desk, I wanted to double-check that there was nothing in the Threads chat I’d want to save — and, I couldn’t figure out how to see DMs in Threads’s web app. I found a few articles, like the one above at The Verge, that said it <em>was</em> available on the web, but ... it isn’t. At least not for me, or most people. One never knows how many people are getting an A/B test or early rollout with Meta.</p>

<p>From a press release from the UK’s National Drought Group this week, quoting group chair Helen Wakeham (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We are grateful to the public for following the restrictions,
where in place, to conserve water in these dry conditions. Simple,
everyday choices — such as turning off a tap or <em>deleting old
emails</em> — also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand
and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To reaffirm that she did not misspeak, from a list of tips for conserving water at home, which includes legit tips like taking shorter showers and turning off the tap while brushing your teeth (<em>Sidenote: Who leaves the water running while brushing their teeth?</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Delete old emails and pictures as data centres require vast
amounts of water to cool their systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is so profoundly stupid and wrong that I don’t even know how to make fun of it. But it sure speaks to how futile it might be to hope that the UK government understand the first thing about end-to-end encryption.

<p>Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Trump administration is in talks with Intel Corp. to have the
US government take a stake in the beleaguered chipmaker, according
to people familiar with the plan, in the latest sign of the White
House’s willingness to blur the lines between state and industry.</p>

<p>A deal would help shore up Intel’s planned factory hub in Ohio,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
deliberations are private. The company had once promised to turn
that site into the world’s largest chipmaking facility, though
it’s been repeatedly delayed. The size of the potential stake
isn’t clear.</p>

<p>The talks come just a week after President Donald Trump had called
for the ouster of Intel Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan,
accusing him of being “highly conflicted” because of concerns
about his earlier ties to China.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bloomberg was first (this time), but <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/us-stake-intel-1ff24500?mod=hp_lead_pos1">the WSJ seconded the report</a> shortly after.</p>

<p>No cause for alarm here. Just a bit of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/14/wall-street-journal-marches-toward-pravda">a sea change</a>. The Republican Party has always been in favor of social ownership of the means of production. Just like we have always been at war with Eastasia. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/11/mad-king-watch-intel">Sane steady leadership</a> from our 80-year-old dear leader, who is definitely not succumbing rapidly to a dangerous mix of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRAjbgvj9Pc">dementia</a>, megalomania, and paranoia.</p>

<p>Greg Ip, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/greg-ip">chief economics commentator</a> for The Wall Street Journal, under the euphemistic headline “The U.S. Marches Toward State Capitalism With American Characteristics”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A generation ago conventional wisdom held that as China
liberalized, its economy would come to resemble America’s.
Instead, capitalism in America is starting to look like China.</p>

<p>Recent examples include President Trump’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/trump-intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-resign-china-ties-cotton-ce111513?mod=article_inline">demand that Intel’s
chief executive resign</a>; the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/nvidia-amd-chip-sales-us-government-f9e34b5f?mod=article_inline">15% of certain chip
sales</a> to China that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices will
share with Washington; the “golden share” Washington will get in
U.S. Steel as a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/trump-nippon-steel-reach-national-security-agreement-on-u-s-steel-deal-4e76633a?mod=article_inline">condition of Nippon Steel’s takeover</a>; and
the $1.5 trillion of promised investment from trading partners
Trump plans to personally direct.</p>

<p>This isn’t socialism, in which the state owns the means of
production. It is more like state capitalism, a hybrid between
socialism and capitalism in which the state guides the decisions
of nominally private enterprises.</p>

<p>China calls its hybrid “socialism with Chinese characteristics.”
The U.S. hasn’t gone as far as China or even milder practitioners
of state capitalism such as Russia, Brazil and, at times, France.
So call this variant “state capitalism with American
characteristics.” It is still a sea change from the free market
ethos the U.S. once embodied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ip’s piece is, on the whole, a decent factual survey of the Trump 2.0 administration’s economic policies, six months in. (Or, if you prefer, one-eighth over, and a quarter of the way through until the mid-term election.) But I can’t help but feel that if it were any Democrat — Biden, Harris, whoever — whose early presidential term’s stewardship of our capitalist economy could aptly be described as “starting to look like China”, the tone would be less “a sea change” and more “<span class="caps">ALL CAPS ALL THE TIME TOTAL FUCKING FREAKOUT</span>”. It’s the same slippery slope of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/on-tyranny">obeying in advance</a> as describing blatantly unconstitutional shakedowns as “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/11/unusual-agreements">unusual agreements</a>”.</p>

<p>There’s grading on the curve and then there’s <em>grading on the curve</em>. Ip knows damn well that if left unchecked, Trump’s mad-king style policies, like firing the economist in charge of the Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/01/business/trump-job-report-number-fire">because the jobs report for July was bad</a>, are going to prove disastrous. That move is more like North Korea than China, and everyone who doesn’t have Fox News injected into their veins knows it. Greg Ip is not drinking the MAGA juice, but he’s not calling fair balls and strikes, either. That’s a problem.</p>

<p>Dieter Bohn left The Verge to work for Google on their “Platforms &amp; Ecosystems” team. He hasn’t had much of a visible presence since, or least not one that I’ve noticed. But this 90-second video he made showing off the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is nice.

	<summary type="text">What today’s workaround does is process and display the blood oxygen sensor data on your watch’s paired iPhone, rather than on the Apple Watch itself. That, apparently, is what the new US Customs ruling holds does not violate Masimo’s patent.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Apple Newsroom this morning, “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/08/an-update-on-blood-oxygen-for-apple-watch-in-the-us/">An Update on Blood Oxygen for Apple Watch in the U.S.</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple will introduce a redesigned Blood Oxygen feature for
some Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2
users through an iPhone and Apple Watch software update coming
later today.</p>

<p>Users with these models in the U.S. who currently do not have the
Blood Oxygen feature will have access to the redesigned Blood
Oxygen feature by updating their paired iPhone to iOS 18.6.1 and
their Apple Watch to watchOS 11.6.1. Following this update, sensor
data from the Blood Oxygen app on Apple Watch will be measured and
calculated on the paired iPhone, and results can be viewed in the
Respiratory section of the Health app. This update was enabled by
a recent U.S. Customs ruling.</p>

<p>There will be no impact to Apple Watch units previously purchased
that include the original Blood Oxygen feature, nor to Apple Watch
units purchased outside of the U.S.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The iOS 18.6.1 and WatchOS 11.6.1 updates appeared a few hours after Apple’s announcement.</p>

<p>If you have an Apple Watch with the blood oxygen sensor purchased <em>outside</em> the US, you can ignore today’s news. You were never affected by the US International Trade Commission import ban (which stems from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/masimo">a patent lawsuit from a company named Masimo</a>), so today’s workaround isn’t necessary. The same goes for Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the US prior to the ban taking effect in January 2024.</p>

<p>What today’s workaround does is process <em>and</em> display the blood oxygen sensor data on your watch’s paired iPhone, rather than on the Apple Watch itself. That, apparently, is what the new US Customs ruling holds does not violate Masimo’s patent. No processing of the sensor data on the watch, and no display of the results on the watch. But the sensor that takes the measurements, of course, is on your watch. If you bought your Apple Watch before the ban, or you bought it outside the US, you still get on-watch processing and on-watch display of results. (Which means users outside the US still have a slightly better blood oxygen experience.)</p>

<p>If your Apple Watch was affected by the import ban, after today’s software updates, you should be able to both initiate a blood oxygen reading manually (using the Blood Oxygen app on the Watch) and get automatic background readings, like when you’re wearing your watch while sleeping. What is different for Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 models in the US that didn’t have the original Blood Oxygen feature, compared to models not affected by the US ban, is where the measurement is <em>calculated</em> and <em>visible</em>. If you initiate a measurement while your watch is out of range of its paired iPhone, the results will be calculated on the iPhone once it is back in range.</p>

<p>Also important, and not clear at all from Apple’s initial announcement this morning: After the iOS 18.6.1 and WatchOS 11.6.1 software updates, the iPhone and Apple Watch need to download an over-the-air asset to enable the redesigned Blood Oxygen feature. This apparently may take up to 24 hours. Until this asset download happens, the Blood Oxygen app on your Apple Watch will still say “The Blood Oxygen app is no longer available”. To jump-start the download, users can open the Health app on their iPhone, and the ECG app on their Apple Watch. I was in this boat personally with an Ultra 2 from last year, and opening the Health app on my iPhone and taking an ECG reading on the watch did the trick — after that, launching the Blood Oxygen app on the watch <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/blood-oxygen-app-watchos-11.6.1.png">showed a new message</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Blood Oxygen App Has Changed</p>

<p>You will now find Blood Oxygen results in the Health app on your iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<strong>Update:</strong> I am reliably informed that you don’t need to take an ECG reading on the watch. Just opening the ECG app is enough to trigger the asset download needed by the Blood Oxygen app. I figured why not take a reading while I was in there, though.)</p>

<p>The US Customs ruling that Apple is citing to allow them to offer this workaround — “HQ H351038”, per a source at Apple — <a href="https://rulings.cbp.gov/">is not yet publicly available</a>. But reading between the lines, the implication is that US Customs has decided that Masimo’s patents only apply to on-device sensor processing (and display of results?).</p>

<p>I continue to think that Masimo is a patent troll. At the time they filed their complaint with the ITC, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/11/apple-masimo-appeals-court">they didn’t even have a smartwatch on the market</a>. And <a href="https://www.masimo.com/products/monitors/masimo-w1-medical-watch/">the smartwatch they now sell</a> — years after filing the complaint — looks like an Apple Watch with a second button instead of a digital crown. The two patents in question (<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10912502B2/en">10,912,502</a> and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10945648B2/en">10,945,648</a>) are set to expire in August 2028, and I suspect this patent suit has been a last-ditch attempt to monetize them before they expire by extorting a settlement from Apple. Good luck with that now.</p>

<p>Alexandra Alper, reporting for Reuters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donald Trump’s Navy and Air Force are poised to cancel two nearly
complete software projects that took 12 years and well over $800
million combined to develop, work initially aimed at overhauling
antiquated human resources systems.</p>

<p>The reason for the unusual move: officials at those departments,
who have so far put the existing projects on hold, want other
firms, including Salesforce and billionaire Peter Thiel’s
Palantir, to have a chance to win similar projects, which could
amount to a costly do-over, according to seven sources familiar
with the matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t want to be a ninny about this, but why is Reuters flatly describing the Navy and Air Force as possessions of the president? Did they ever describe them as belonging to Joe Biden, or Barack Obama? I don’t think they did, and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areuters.com%20%22joe%20biden%27s%20navy%22&amp;udm=14">a cursory search</a> suggests they did not, but even if they did, it was wrong then. Now is not the time for sloppy language around this.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is both as crooked and stupid as shit.</p>

<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/12/trump-doge-contract-claims-savings-inflation-00498178">Jessie Blaeser, reporting for Politico</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Trump administration’s claim that it is saving billions of
dollars through DOGE-related cuts to federal contracts is
drastically exaggerated, according to a new Politico analysis of
public data and federal spending records.</p>

<p>Through July, DOGE said it has saved taxpayers $52.8 billion by
canceling contracts, but of the $32.7 billion in actual claimed
contract savings that Politico could verify, DOGE’s savings over
that period were closer to $1.4 billion. Despite the
administration’s claims, not a single one of those 1.4 billion
dollars will lower the federal deficit unless Congress steps in.
Instead, the money has been returned to agencies mandated by law
to spend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DOGE scam was never about saving money. It was about destroying honest government programs and projects to redirect the firehose of taxpayer money to American oligarchs like Thiel, one of Elon Musk’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia">“PayPal Mafia” cronies</a>.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The Information (paywalled, alas):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In December, Perplexity discussed possibly buying the six-year-old
The Browser Co. with that company’s leaders, according to two
people with knowledge of the discussions. Talks with the company,
which operates an AI-powered web browser, Dia, did not progress,
and no price was discussed.</p>

<p>OpenAI has also spoken to The Browser Co. executives about
possibly selling to the ChatGPT creator, according to two people
familiar with the discussions. Those discussions went further, to
the point of a possible price, but ended after the two sides
couldn’t agree on terms.</p>

<p>Then, earlier this summer, Perplexity offered to buy Brave, a San
Francisco–based company that runs a privacy-focused web browser
and search engine, for around $1 billion, primarily in
Perplexity’s stock, according to a person with direct knowledge of
the situation. But the two sides couldn’t agree on price and the
deal discussions didn’t move forward, the person said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, investors in Perplexity and DuckDuckGo tried to arrange
meetings between the two companies’ leaders, according to people
close to the companies. Perplexity CEO Srinivas and Gabriel
Weinberg, CEO of 17-year-old DuckDuckGo, met and discussed
Perplexity’s interest in acquiring browsers as a way of reaching
more consumers, one of the people said. The conversations didn’t
lead to any offer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DuckDuckGo is even more privacy-focused than Brave. <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/privacy-simplified/">It’s their entire brand</a>. Perplexity isn’t privacy-focused at all. And Perplexity has already made their own browser, <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/comet">Comet</a>, which is so cool you currently have to pay $200/month to get access to it. Comet is, unsurprisingly, forked from Chromium, and pretty much looks like an uglier version of Chrome. <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser</a> looks almost exactly like Chrome (and is probably my favorite Chromium-based browser).</p>

<p>None of this makes any sense, so it’s no surprise most of these talks didn’t go far, and Brave rejected the supposed $1 billion offer in Perplexity stock, which as far as I’m concerned might as well have been $1 billion in Monopoly money. Why not call Eddy Cue and see if Apple wants to sell Safari?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Just today, <a href="https://x.com/perplexity_ai/status/1955684209483534657">Perplexity announced</a> that Comet is now available to $20/month Plus users, not just $200/month Pro users.</p>

	<summary type="text">It’s like an otherwise delightful cocktail with one distinctive unpleasant ingredient, which ingredient was added, deliberately, to imbue the libation with an aftertaste of spite.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Max Read, two years ago, “<a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/a-literary-history-of-fake-texts?r=71ygg">A Literary History of Fake Texts in Apple’s Marketing Materials</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m talking about the mocked-up texts and emails Apple puts
together to demonstrate new messaging features in its
operating-system updates, presumably written by some well-paid
professionals in Apple’s marketing department. These eerily
cheery, aggressively punctuated messages suggest an alternate
dimension in which polite, good-natured, rigorously diverse groups
of friends and coworkers use Apple products exactly how they are
designed to be used, without complaint or error. [...]</p>

<p>If there is still mystery in Apple events, it is located here,
in the uncanny fictional world suggested in these images: Who
are these people? And what is wrong with them that they text
like this?</p>

<p>A proper literary study of fake Apple texts has yet to be
undertaken, but with the help of the Wayback Machine, we can sift
through more than a decade’s work of marketing materials to
identify certain trends and themes. For the sake of precision,
let’s begin our survey in 2011, with the launch of iMessage in iOS
5. Here, so far as I can tell, is the first-ever fake Apple
iMessage conversation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been sitting on this one since shortly after Read published it, and came upon it again today in my pile of I-should-post-about-this-but-I-have-a-lot-I-need-to-say-about-it links. Now — just under four weeks away from Apple’s expected keynote for the iPhones 17 and new Apple Watches — seems as good a time as ever to finally link to it. It really is a lot of fun, and Read seemingly found every marketing screenshot of Messages or Mail from 2011–2023 that he could.</p>

<p>But re-reading it today, I realize why I sat on it. There’s a cynicism to the whole thing that grates. Read is disdainful of everything about these messages — their cheerful tone, professional-grade photography, even their attentive punctuation. But of course they’re not realistic. Of course every person in every chat “use[s] Apple products exactly how they are designed to be used, without complaint or error.” Of course everyone is always happy and friendly and having a good time. Of course the groups are always diverse.<sup id="fnr1-2025-08-13"><a href="#fn1-2025-08-13">1</a></sup> What other kinds of fictional people are going to be portrayed by Apple in their marketing screenshots? Ugly unhappy illiterates who take bad photos and never go anywhere? It’d be really weird if Apple’s fake texts for keynotes were anything other than idyllic — if the photos kinda sucked, if words were misspelled and entirely lowercase, if punctuation were omitted.</p>

<p>So of course the fake texts in Apple marketing are, upon consideration, obviously phony. What I’ve long thought interesting is just how much effort Apple clearly puts into them. They’re <em>good</em> phony. Pitch-perfect for Apple’s Designed-in-California brand. A lot of work goes into the fake trips and parties portrayed and described in these threads, and it shows. But they’re not <em>so</em> interesting as to distract from the keynote. Imagine if a screenshot flew by with a Messages thread between colleagues gossiping about someone getting fired for expense account fraud, or about an extramarital affair. The purpose of these fake texts is the opposite of the supposed intention of the Liquid Glass design language: it’s fake content meant to put the emphasis on the real software. They’re actually worth the deep dive Max Read produced to document them. They’re genuinely interesting for what they are — but somehow Read can’t bring himself to say that, despite taking the time to document them. The withering cynicism of his tone is at odds with the fact that he took the time to document their history so thoroughly.</p>

<p>Searching the DF archive for Read’s name, I came up with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/12/roman_a_clef_computer_maker">one hit</a>, and it explains his overly-cynical schtick. Read was editor-in-chief at Gawker, before Peter Thiel and his puppet Hulk Hogan (RIP) <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/">sued them out of business in 2016</a>. And when I previously mentioned Read (in 2020), <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/12/roman_a_clef_computer_maker">it was because he was one of two ex-Gawkerites who sold a show to Apple TV+ called <em>Scraper</em></a><sup id="fnr2-2025-08-13"><a href="#fn2-2025-08-13">2</a></sup> about a thinly-veiled fictional version of Gawker, but which show was nixed, after several episodes had already been filmed, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/business/media/apple-gawker-tim-cook.html">supposedly by Tim Cook himself</a>, out of his personal loathing for Gawker. To be clear, I’m not suggesting Read took an overly snarky attitude to describing Apple’s fake-text literary history because Cook pulled the plug on <em>Scrapers</em>. I’m saying that Gawker was infused by the sort of attitude that holds all marketing in contempt. I, of course, firmly believe that many subjects are worthy of withering scorn. But the Gawker attitude was that no subject was worthy of anything but withering scorn. I never could abide that, and there’s something like it undergirding this otherwise splendid piece from Read. It’s like an otherwise delightful cocktail with one distinctive unpleasant ingredient, which ingredient was added, deliberately, to imbue the libation with an aftertaste of spite.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Eric Migicovsky:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First off, for those who didn’t catch the <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/july-pebble-update">news from a few weeks
ago</a> — we’ve been able to recover the Pebble trademark! Our
new watches will change from being called Core 2 Duo → Pebble 2
Duo, and Core Time 2 → Pebble Time 2.</p>

<p>The big news today is that we’re revealing the final design for
Pebble Time 2. The design that we showed off back in March were
preliminary designs. We’ve been able to tweak and improve the
industrial design quite a bit since then. I think it’s turned out
fantastically well! I even have a working albeit early engineering
sample on my wrist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These look good. Fundamentally Pebble-y but with smaller-than-ever (for Pebble) screen bezels.</p>

<p>I stand by <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/repebble-watches">what I wrote back in March</a>, though. They should make just one new watch, not two. In March I suggested that the one new Pebble watch they should make ought to be the black-and-white display one, to lean into Pebble’s differentiation from Apple Watch and other leading smartwatches. Seeing these new designs for the color display Time 2 — and Migicovsky’s obvious personal enthusiasm for <em>this</em> model — makes me think that this should be the one true new Pebble. They should scrap the black-and-white plastic one.</p>

<p>Even their naming scheme is confusing. The $150 plastic, 1.2-inch black-and-white-display model is the Pebble 2 Duo. The $225 steel, 1.5-inch color-display model is the Pebble Time 2. Why is the “2” in different places? Nothing about the names “Duo” or “Time” suggests which one is higher-end than the other. If anything, “Time” sounds more simplistic to my ears, like maybe it only tells the time — but that’s the nicer one.</p>

<p>Maybe they know something I don’t, and pre-orders are strong for the uglier, plastic, black-and-white-display 2 Duo. But even if that’s true, that’s selling into the existing Pebble fanbase. If they have any hope of expanding to new users, they ought to put all their wood behind one arrow, and that ought to be the clearly superior, better-looking, bigger-display Time 2. The Time 2 costs just $75 more, but seems way more than $75 better.</p>

<p>New app from Devin Davies, developer of the ADA-winning <a href="https://crouton.app/">Crouton</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cassette is an app for iPhone and iPad that helps you enjoy your
home videos like the good old days. With a retro interface
Cassette auto plays through videos from your devices’ Photo
Library. Mirror your device to a nearby Apple TV for a true kick
back experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The VHS retro pastiche is fun, but don’t get the wrong impression from it. Cassette is <em>not</em> an app that makes your modern videos look like they were shot on an old camcorder. (<a href="https://rarevision.com/vhs-camcorder-app/">Rarevision VHS</a> is a fun app for that, if that’s what you’re looking for.)</p>

<p>Cassette’s tape-playing pastiche is more about putting you in the right mindset. Instead of watching one video from your Photos library, or two or three, it mimics popping in a tape labelled, say, “2014” and sitting back and watching an entire hour of videos from a decade ago. It just launched today but I’ve been using the beta via TestFlight for a few weeks, and you really have to try it to see how effective it is. Davies made a nice video teaser to pitch the app. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iQwZ09OIao">It’s good, you should watch it</a>.</p>

<p>The way I’d pitch it is that Cassette is to the videos in your Photos library what the Kodak Carousel was to your 35mm film slides back in the 1960s. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus"><em>Nostalgia</em>. It’s delicate, but potent.</a></p>

<p>Haleluya Hadero and Christopher Rugaber, reporting for the AP back on January 26, six days into Trump 2.0:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perplexity AI has presented a new proposal to TikTok’s parent
company that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a
new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok’s U.S. business,
according to a person familiar with the matter. The proposal,
submitted last week, is a revision of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-us-ban-trump-extension-a3936a93f174d176d3633a67554d771b">a prior plan</a> the
artificial intelligence startup had presented to TikTok’s parent
ByteDance on Jan. 18, a day before the law that bans TikTok went
into effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They should have added a similar provision to their <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/12/perplexity-jumps-shark-stunt-offer-to-buy-chrome">Chrome offer sheet</a> today. Give 25% to the US Treasury and another 25% to Trump’s future presidential “library”.</p>

<p>Katherine Blunt, reporting for The Wall Street Journal (main link is a paywall-puncturing gift link; <a href="https://apple.news/AM1sqivpIRdmGRm-i3uhOwg">also on News+</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Artificial-intelligence startup Perplexity on Tuesday offered to
purchase Google’s Chrome browser for $34.5 billion as it works to
challenge the tech giant’s web-search dominance.</p>

<p>Perplexity’s offer is significantly more than its own valuation,
which is estimated at $18 billion. The company told The Wall
Street Journal that several investors including large
venture-capital funds had agreed to back the transaction in full.
Estimates of Chrome’s enterprise value vary widely but recent ones
have ranged from $20 billion to $50 billion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perplexity apparently also told the Journal that the story was theirs exclusively, despite the fact that <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/115017196029068928">they also revealed the stunt offer to Bloomberg as well</a>. Prefixing a headline with “Exclusive:” is irresistible catnip to business/investor-oriented publications. The Journal, at least, had the good sense to raise a skeptical eyebrow at the premise in its headline (“Perplexity Makes Longshot $34.5 Billion Offer for Chrome”<sup id="fnr1-2025-08-12"><a href="#fn1-2025-08-12">1</a></sup>). Bloomberg, not so much (“AI Startup Perplexity Makes $34.5 Billion Bid for Google’s Chrome Browser”).</p>

<p>The whole premise is ludicrous. Start with the fact that Perplexity is only valued at $18 billion. Add to that the fact that Perplexity is almost certainly overvalued at that price. I don’t know anyone who uses Perplexity, and Perplexity doesn’t develop or run their own LLMs.</p>

<p>But all of this stuff about Google possibly being forced (as a remedy in the <em>US v. Google</em> antitrust case they lost) to sell Chrome doesn’t consider that Chrome, on its own, divested from Google and thus disconnected from Chrome users’ Google accounts, is likely worth little to nothing. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/is_chrome_even_a_sellable_asset">I wrote about this at length back in April</a>. Chrome is tremendously valuable to Google. It has very little value on its own. Chrome generates no revenue on its own — it simply serves as an outlet for Google to show its own lucrative search ads without paying traffic acquisition fees to a browser owned by someone else (like, say, Apple or Mozilla or Samsung). <a href="https://www.chromium.org/">Chromium is open source</a>. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">Microsoft Edge</a> is forked from it. <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> is forked from it. <a href="https://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> (remember them?) forked from it <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/02/presto-is-dead-long-live-opera">over a decade ago</a>. Perplexity (or any actually credible would-be buyer of Chrome) could just start their own fork.</p>

<p>There are two things Chrome has that other Chromium browsers don’t: billions of users, and integration with Google account services. Chrome has those billions of users <em>because of</em> the Google account integration. Severed from Google, Chrome users would lose those essential features — possibly including Google Search — and they’d likely begin switching away in droves.</p>

<p>I wrote just last week that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/05/regarding-those-rumors-of-apple-pursuing-an-acquisition-of-perplexity">Perplexity looks like a scam</a>. Someone is spreading rumors that Apple is sniffing around at buying them, despite the fact that the two companies are an absurdly bad cultural match. I think what’s happening is that the LLM chatbot field is maturing (exemplified by OpenAI’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/openai_chatgpt_models_emotional_attachment">launch of ChatGPT 5 last week</a>), and Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas is getting increasingly desperate. Desperate moves <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/05/cloudflare-perplexity">to seek an edge in product</a>, and desperate moves to seek publicity that Perplexity’s product can’t garner on its meager merits.</p>

<p>Demetri Sevastopulo and Michael Acton, reporting for the Financial Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the US government 15 per cent
of the revenues from chip sales in China, as part of an unusual
arrangement with the Trump administration to obtain export
licences for the semiconductors. [...]</p>

<p>The quid pro quo arrangement is unprecedented. According to export
control experts, no US company has ever agreed to pay a portion of
their revenues to obtain export licences.</p>

<p>But the deal <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4273254b-6e1f-4cb1-bca7-19c7389c719a">fits a pattern</a> in the Trump administration
where the president urges companies to take measures, such as
domestic investments, for example, to prevent the imposition of
tariffs in an effort to bring in jobs and revenue to America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This FT report starts out on shaky ground, using <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/11/unusual-agreements">the same “unusual agreement” euphemism</a> as the WSJ and NYT reports, but they soon found a little backbone with “The quid pro quo arrangement is unprecedented.”</p>

<p>This is not merely unusual. It is unprecedented. Seemingly, too, <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S9-C5-1/ALDE_00013596/">plainly unconstitutional</a>.</p>

<p>Quipped a friend: “Nvidia and AMD’s general counsels must be wondering how much of this money they can eventually get back, if we ever reverse the banana republic index.”</p>

<p>Amrith Ramkumar and Robbie Whelan, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/nvidia-amd-chip-sales-us-government-f9e34b5f?st=pdZkXp&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">reporting for The Wall Street Journal</a> (gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have agreed to give the Trump
administration a portion of the sales from their
artificial-intelligence chips to China, unusual agreements that
deepen their relationships with the U.S. government.</p>

<p>The Trump administration will receive 15% of the sales as part of
a deal to approve exports of Nvidia’s H20 AI chip to China,
according to people familiar with the matter. That could amount
to billions of dollars given demand for the H20 chips and is the
latest example of the White House employing novel tactics to
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/patent-system-overhaul-18e0f06f?mod=article_inline">raise revenue</a>. The administration has reached the same
agreement with AMD for its MI308 chip, the people said. Details
of the arrangements and the financial structures are still being
worked out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tripp Mickle, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/technology/us-government-nvidia-amd-chips-china.html?unlocked_article_code=1.dU8.gRPU.NCzEdPe_DR63&amp;smid=url-share">reporting on the same story for The New York Times</a> (also a gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are expected to pay the United
States 15 percent of the money they take in from selling
artificial intelligence chips to China, as part of a highly
unusual financial agreement with the Trump administration.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, met with
President Trump at the White House and agreed to give the federal
government its 15 percent cut, essentially making the federal
government a partner in Nvidia’s business in China, said the
people familiar with the deal. The Commerce Department began
granting licenses for A.I. chip sales two days later, these people
said. [...]</p>

<p>There are few precedents for the Commerce Department agreeing to
grant licenses for exports in exchange for a share of revenue. But
the unorthodox payments are consistent with Mr. Trump’s
increasingly interventionist role in international business deals
involving American companies. In June, the administration approved
investment by Nippon Steel, a Japanese company, in U.S. Steel in a
deal that included a so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/business/us-steel-nippon-steel-partnership-deal.html">golden share in the
company</a>, a rarely used practice where the government takes
a stake in a business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Unusual agreements</em> is quite the euphemism for a shakedown. US companies pay the Treasury a share of their revenue all the time, of course. That’s called taxation. But taxes are laws, written by Congress. There’s no tax here. Congress has played zero role whatsoever in these deals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/11/trump-defends-deal-to-sell-nvidia-export-control-license-00503778">CNN, today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Donald Trump defended a deal he struck with Nvidia CEO
Jensen Huang to allow the sale of certain semiconductor chips to
China in exchange for the company giving the U.S. government 15
percent of the revenue.</p>

<p>“I said, ‘I want 20 percent if I’m going to approve this for
you,’” Trump told reporters Monday during a White House press
conference. “For the country, for our country. I don’t want it
myself. … And he said, ‘Would you make it 15?‘ So we negotiate
a little deal.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tell here, revealing just how fucked up <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">this whole thing</a> is getting, is that Trump felt the need to say “For the country, for our country. I don’t want it myself.”</p>

<p>CNBC:</p>

  <p>President Donald Trump on Monday delayed high U.S. tariffs on
Chinese goods from snapping back into place for another 90 days, a
White House official told CNBC. [...]</p>

<p>Monday’s extension is the latest example of how Trump’s on-again,
off-again tariffs have shifted with little prior notice, a dynamic
that has made U.S. trade policy unpredictable for many businesses.</p>

<p>Bonus question for the CNBC copy desk: how much water is the word <em>many</em> carrying in that closing sentence?</p>

<p>Mark Tyson at Tom’s Hardware:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AOL, now a Yahoo property, will end its dial-up internet service,
the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)-based internet
connectivity service, <a href="https://help.aol.com/articles/dial-up-internet-to-be-discontinued">on September 30, 2025</a>. Its dial-up service
has been publicly available for 34 years, and has provided many an
internet surfer’s first taste of the WWW. AOL will also end its
AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser. RIP slowband.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/757194/aol-dial-up-is-dead">Thomas Ricker at The Verge</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might be surprised that the service was still operating. I’m
not. At last count, a 2019 <a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2019.B28011?q=ACSDT1Y2019.B28011&amp;hidePreview=true">US census</a> estimated that 265,000
people in the United States were still using dial-up internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unsurprisingly, I never used AOL, but, I of course did use dial-up service to access the Internet. First for a few years while still a student at Drexel, then through some sort of commercial service here in Philadelphia. I forget the name of the company. But I do remember using <a href="https://www.sustworks.com/site/prod_ipr_overview.html">IPNetRouter</a>, a terrific classic Mac utility by Peter Sichel/Sustainable Softworks that allowed you to share a dial-up connection with your LAN. (Amazingly, the Sustainable Softworks website is still up, seemingly unchanged for decades.)</p>

<p>So when my now-wife and I moved in together in 1999, I set up a LAN connecting our Macs and my HP LaserJet. My Mac was connected to a modem, which used a second phone line that was just for Internet access. When either of our Macs tried to access the Internet, IPNetRouter, running all the time on my <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powermac/specs/powermac_9600_350.html">PowerMac 9600/350</a>, would initiate a dial-up connection that both of us could use at the same time. It felt like a pretty nifty setup.</p>

<p>I don’t recall when we first got a broadband connection — DSL for a few years, then cable — but I’m thinking it might have been as early as 2000 or 2001. It certainly wasn’t too long after that. So I think I only ever used dial-up modems for six or seven years. Maybe eight years, tops. But in hindsight those years feel like an entire era of my life. Those connections were just breathtakingly slow. But slow, finicky Internet service in your home was infinitely more amazing and fun and useful than what we were all used to — which was not having any sort of online connectivity at all. We all knew what it was like to have “real” Internet speeds in buildings on our college campuses or, for some of us, in offices where we went to work. So we knew that even the fastest dial-up connection was painfully slow. But we made do. Software was designed to treat bandwidth — each and every request — as a precious, limited resource. It was a deliberate choice, by you, the user, to “go online” to, say, check and send email. Developers took pains to make their apps as small as possible, because downloading even a few megabytes could take a while. Websites eschewed bloat, because if a website was bloated, no one would bother going there. In some ways, overall, things were better because the technology was so much worse. My nostalgia for that era is quite profound — exemplified, of course, by my Pavlovian affection for the distinctive grating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVkWE2AQvgA">sound of a modem initiating its connection</a>.</p>

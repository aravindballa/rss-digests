I do.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I was recently watching <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzgXKvxbyPg&list=PLzI16LSYAwDb0DjMUHUo5ILnMFPcZGazo&utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=one-of-a-kind-coffee-filter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">2025 World Brewers Cup videos</a> and came across something very interesting.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">It is a filter, used in making a pour over coffee, that doesn&#39;t let plain water pass through initially, until the first parts of the coffee is extracted.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I know this is cool but before we look into why and how that is possible, let&#39;s talk about why filters in coffee brewing.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Filters are what separate coffee from water. So they do seem to play a crucial role.</p><h2 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="types-of-filters">Types of filters</h2><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Broadly, there are 3 types of filters - <b>paper, metal and cloth</b>.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><b>Paper filters</b> are the most used. For all types of major types of coffee brewing like pour overs, Aeropress, chemex etc. They tend to filter very well, effectively trapping oils and fine particles resulting in clean cup with enhanced brightness and acidity. The best part about these is that there is no sediments in the cup.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><b>Metal filters</b> have larger pores than the paper ones, allowing oils and fines to pass to the cup. It results in much fuller body and a good mouth feel.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is not always not desirable. There were a lot of Aeropress Championships which were won with a metal filter.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><b>Cloth ones</b>, although I haven&#39;t used them yet, seem to be a middle ground between paper and metal. It has a faster flow rate than paper which means higher extraction.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Flow rate is the speed with which water passes through the coffee bed and falls into the cup. Matters only in percolation type brews like pour overs, or the unverted aeropress.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Now, in paper filters, there are <i>yet a few types</i>. Not all paper filters are the same. You can choose ones based on the flow rate or their ability catch the micro-fines from going into our cups. For example, if brewing with dark roasts, Cafec T-90 helps you not over extract with a faster flow rate.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This difference is achieved based on how thick and porous the papers are made. They can choose to have different textures inside and outside.</p><h2 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="coming-to-the-oneofakind-one">Coming to the one-of-a-kind one</h2><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/eb09f06c-1b35-43a1-905d-f7ac4e0bcb21/Screenshot_2025-05-24_at_11.35.27_2x.png?t=1748067021"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p>Water is in the filter but doesn&#39;t drip. <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/OnUGoLwp1cI?t=214&utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=one-of-a-kind-coffee-filter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Source</a></p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This one is so new I could not find any material online.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">It is essentially a hydrophobic filter. Meaning that it repells water. So initial till it is only water and nothing else, nothing passes. This results in an immersion style bloom for some time. My guess is that it improves the acidity and sweetness.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Slowly when the coffee starts to extract, chemicals in coffee react with the filter and let it pass and it becomes a normal filer.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">All of this is fascinating to me. I hope I passed on some of it to you now as well.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">As usual, let me leave you with some links so that you can explore further.</p><h2 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="more-links-to-explore">More Links to explore</h2><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube_embed" frameborder="0" height="100%" src="https://youtube.com/embed/HfVjGx1x7Ds" width="100%"></iframe><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube_embed" frameborder="0" height="100%" src="https://youtube.com/embed/Ca2BMotyyAc" width="100%"></iframe><h2 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="the-competition-video">The competition video üëáüèº</h2><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube_embed" frameborder="0" height="100%" src="https://youtube.com/embed/OnUGoLwp1cI" width="100%"></iframe><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">That‚Äôs all I have.

Most Indians are into milk based coffees and Moka is just perfectly positioned to enhance a milk coffee.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">With this ~1000 INR priced brewer which operates on a stovetop, you can make multiple types of coffee ‚Äì a near espresso style drink, a americano style drink and a regular milk based coffee like cortado or a cappuccino.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">For time to time, I enjoy a strong bold jolt of coffee that I can brew from the Moka.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">A lot of people call it a stove top Espresso Maker. But it is technically not an espresso. It might have the same strength of the coffee but it is extracted at a way low, under 2 bars of pressure, compared to espresso which is 9 bars.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">While brewing with this is easy enough, I used to make a mess and didn&#39;t like what it was producing. I definitely knew it was skill issue and researched a bit about it, leading me to enjoy this drink.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I will leave you with the tricks and tips so you can build on top of my mistakes when you start.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="how-it-works-brews">How it <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">works</span> brews</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Like espresso, a mokapot uses pressure to drive water through coffee and extract. It&#39;s quite fascinating actually.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/3c39f262-192b-4b65-9cb3-55d69e71b6b6/28233.png?t=1747539767"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p>Parts of the Moka pot</p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">We put water in the below chamber, coffee in the funnel which is ground fairly fine but not espresso grind, screw the whole thing together and put it on a stove top.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The heat makes the water boil and slowly it starts to turn into vapour. Because the system is completely locked, there is nowhere for the vapour to go. So it pushes this water which is getting hot and makes spaces for itself. Where would the water go? Only way it has is to raise up through the coffee, in the funnel.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/2fca279c-2aac-4ba6-899c-c9981c6774f7/Untitled_Artwork.jpg?t=1747539795"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p>How water flows.</p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">And that&#39;s how, my friend, you get a beautiful cup of coffee brewed with the Mokapot.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">You can treat this as the base coffee for a lot of drinks you can make. Hot water makes it Americano. Adding milk is a great option. You can even drink it straight if you enjoy a bitter jolt.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Best part is that you can mixers, like sparkling water or orange juice or tonic water or ginger ale. It becomes a beautiful refreshing summer drink. This coffee has the right concentration to be mixed with these things.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If you remember, I told you I wasn‚Äôt getting satisfactory cups in the beginning.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="things-that-have-fixed-the-taste-fo">Things that have fixed the taste for me</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">First is to not let it sputter. After the coffee is almost done extracting, it starts sputtering. We should immediately remove from the stove top and maybe run it through cold water to let it cool. Whatever comes after this phase is not tasty.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The goal should be to get most of the water through the coffee grounds before it starts to sputter.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This gets me to my second point which is to start with boiling water. The main advantage of this is that it takes less time to brew. And the brewing starts at a good temperature (around 90C). If you take room temperature water, water that gets pushed through the coffee is not yet at optimal temperature, and you get an under extracted feel. This alone got a substantial improvement in the taste.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Below are a few optional ones that you don&#39;t really have to do but if done, the taste and feel is slightly improved.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If your grind has many fines, there is a possibility that they end up in your cup. The last sip with coffee grounds is not a good experience. What helps here is an Aeropress paper filter. Yes, you heard it right.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/2cac50ba-43c3-483e-9209-95a6ba182603/Screenshot_2025-05-18_at_09.15.43_2x.png?t=1747539984"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p>Aeropress filter on the moka pot upper chamber</p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">You put an Aeropress filter on the upper chamber and wet it a little bit so that it sticks there until you screw this to the lower chamber.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This not only helps in filtering out the fines but also improves the taste by preserving some acidity of the coffee.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I hope these tips and tricks help you as well in your Moka journey.</p><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">That‚Äôs all I have. Have a caffeinated weekend.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">See you.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Keep on brewing!</p></div><div class='beehiiv__footer'><br class='beehiiv__footer__break'><hr class='beehiiv__footer__line'><a target="_blank" class="beehiiv__footer_link" style="text-align: center;" href="https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=72f4aef2-cc09-4e6e-b21a-ec802e725be3&utm_medium=post_rss&utm_source=caffeineletter">Powered by beehiiv</a></div></div>

Lot of people make a strong cup and use it like an espresso for milk based drinks. Or make it with a pour over consistency and drink it straight.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">It is also very forgiving in my opinion. You don&#39;t need your grinds to be perfect, or need any extra equipment like gooseneck kettle or a scale. You can start with just the brewer and that makes it a beginner friendly brewer.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">It became so popular a couple of years after it was invented. Soon people started having competition all over the world.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="why-was-it-invented">Why was it invented?</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Alan Adler, an Aerodynamics Engineer, invented Aeropress to have a quick way to get a nice cup of coffee. Time and a single cup were the priorities back then.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Single cup used to be one of the cons back then. But now we have an XL version of the cup. And also a smaller more compact GO version aimed at travel. I use the original version though.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="lets-get-to-brewing-now">Let‚Äôs get to brewing now</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">There are essentially two ways one can brew with an Aeropress. Normal way where the chamber, with the filter attached or an inverted way where the piston and chamber are in an upside down position.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/4e40b0ae-8efa-4bcc-a734-592d8eee25bc/IMG_0988.jpeg?t=1746880877"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p>The two ways: Normal and Inverted</p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Let me tell you how I like to brew it.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I like to do it in the inverted fashion. I get more control like this. 12g of ground coffee to start with in the chamber, I put some hot water to fully make the coffee wet. I swirl it and wait for the coffee to bloom for about 30 seconds. Pour the rest of the water to almost fill the chamber. Wait for 2 minutes, put the filter cap and flip the whole Aeropress over a cup and plunge.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/e40e07c7-7e7b-4ac1-85f1-0e7c13a3bf0c/IMG_0990.jpeg?t=1746881001"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p>Parts of an Aeropress</p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The whole process takes about 3 minutes. I end up with a nice and consistent cup all times.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If you observe, there are no specific calculations involved here. For the coffee as well, you can use one particular spoon all the time and measure it like one spoon or two spoons.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is what makes it travel friendly as well. I carry the spoon with which I measure the coffee. I get a kettle at almost all the places I stay.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="what-about-the-normal-method">What about the normal method?</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The non inverted, or the unverted method like the reddit folks call it also has it‚Äôs own advantage.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Immersion and Percolation are two major categories of coffee brewing. What we saw above with the inverted method is immersion, where the coffee is in contact with the water all the time. In percolation, coffee extracted by flowing through water.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">In the normal method, we can use a mix of percolation and immersion.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">When you put the chamber with the filter on a cup and pour water over the coffee in it, water flows through and falls into the cup. Then you can keep pouring until desired level and then attach the plunger on top. If you don‚Äôt press the plunger, the water stays in the chamber without dripping in the cup, which is immersion mode.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Lots to experiment here right?</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="some-cons">Some cons</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">One majorly discussed con is that you can‚Äôt brew more than a cup with this Aeropress. Even though there is Aeropress XL, there are a few hacks to brew a bigger cup two cups with a standard Aeropress as well.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The idea is that you brew a much stronger cup with more coffee, and then you add hot water and dilute the brew to a better intensity. This is called bypassing.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">One more con is that the Aeropress is made with plastic. They tell you the plastic is BPA-free though. And it is always better to buy an original one than the knock offs available. There is also one Premium version that comes in glass and metal but that is pricey again.</p><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Let me leave you with some links to dive deep, some recipes, some science etc instead of going on and rambling here. <i>Didn‚Äôt realised I wrote these many words.</i></p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube_embed" frameborder="0" height="100%" src="https://youtube.com/embed/bl0mV6Nb0GQ" width="100%"></iframe><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube_embed" frameborder="0" height="100%" src="https://youtube.com/embed/CafyJ2p0Bgs" width="100%"></iframe><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube_embed" frameborder="0" height="100%" src="https://youtube.com/embed/jBXm8fCWdo8" width="100%"></iframe><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">So, what do you think about the Aeropress?

No, I got eliminated too soon.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">You&#39;d probably stop reading. But don&#39;t you learn a lot from mistakes compared to wins?</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Let&#39;s talk about the championship itself and not the Aeropress much as that deserves a post in itself.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The format of the competition is elimination. You brew the coffee along with 2 others. The judges will blind taste the coffee and pick one cup they like. If your cup is picked, you go to the next round.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">First the regionals take place. Top 3 winners go compete at Nationals. One winner then competes Internationally.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="preparation">Preparation</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Around 10 days before the event, you receive a bag of competition coffee beans. These are the same ones you will get during the competition.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">During this time, we experiment with the beans trying out different recipes and tweaking the controllables with Aeropress coffee brewing.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The parameters you can tweak are - temperature, grind size, coffee to water ratio and the time to brew.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">You can search on YouTube for recipes or even championship recipes. There are tonnes of them. If you already brew with an Aeropess, it&#39;s best to stick to what you already do and tweak things. One thing to remember with the recipes you find online is that the beans are not the same - so the result cup will differ.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">And when you burry yourself with a lot of recipes, it quickly gets overwhelming and returns diminish. Bloom or not, preheat the paper or not etc confuse you and they don&#39;t even affect the resulting cup.</p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube_embed" frameborder="0" height="100%" src="https://youtube.com/embed/jBXm8fCWdo8" width="100%"></iframe><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is a good video to go through where James Hoffmann talks about what would affect the cup and what would not. Prioritize more brews with one recipe and parameter tweaks that many different recipes.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Take a note of the taste notes and the mouthfeel of the coffee, the recipe, and the parameters you used.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I suggest doing this experiments over 10 days you have. I could not do this properly as I was traveling. Just before the competition, I brew around 12 cups in 2 days. And by the end of if, I guess my tongue got fatigue, I couldn&#39;t tell the difference between cups.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The outcome from this should ideally be one recipe and a good understanding of tweaking which parameter changes what. This is crucial because at the competition you have to brew a cup which is different from the other 2 brewing alongside you and a good cup.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="at-the-competition">At the competition</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I arrived at the cafe, where the competition was taking place, with all my equipment - Aeropress, grinder, kettle, filters etc. only to discover they provide all the equipment.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Any which ways, I practiced on my equipment so I used only those in the competition. They had a world class Mahklong automatic grinder, but I used my Timemore C2 for the experiments. I didn&#39;t want to make last minute changes.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I was surprised to see more than 50 members participating in the championship. Most of them were baristas from caf√©s. There were a handful home brewers like me.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Coming to brewing coffee, one of the mistakes I did was to not take into account how cool the room was. I practice in my kitchen at home. Here, there was an AC set at 18deg blasting cool air from my back when I was brewing. My recipe had water at 80deg which is already cool than regular ones. AC cooled it more. What I had was a weak under-extracted cup.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This cannot be the only reason, obviously. I could have prepared well with a nicer recipe if I had all the 10 days to understand the beans.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">A few more tips that I picked from look at others brewing and talking to the participants there:</p><ul><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">It is good to check if the equipment you use is allowed or not. In my case, I had a metal filter for Aeropress which was from a 3rd party and not from original Aeropress company. This wasn&#39;t allowed. Thankfully, a co participant had the original one and they let me borrow it. <i>Neither of us made it to the next round, that&#39;s irrelavant.</i></p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The equipment can give up in the middle of your brew. So it&#39;s good to carry yours and making sure it has fresh batteries etc. It happened to a participant that the scale stopped functioning midway. In situations like this, you have to eyeball stuff and that can only be done if you have practiced a lot.</p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Remember to keep an eye on how you co brewers are brewing.</p></li></ul><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">There is a lot to take away from the competition. Just being in a room full for coffee enthusiasts boosts you. Everyone is friendly.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Would I participate again next year? Hell yeah.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Should you participate? Yes. Even if you are just a beginner. People are supportive. You will discover and learn a lot.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I hope this helps you in your preparation and motivates you to participate.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I want to leave you with a few links that helped in my preparation:</p><ul><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@roasting_hands/search?query=aeropress&utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=aeropress-championship-2025-lessons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/@roasting_hands/search?query=aeropress</a></p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://coffeeadastra.com/2021/09/07/reaching-fuller-flavor-profiles-with-the-aeropress/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=aeropress-championship-2025-lessons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://coffeeadastra.com/2021/09/07/reaching-fuller-flavor-profiles-with-the-aeropress/</a></p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://coffeeadastra.com/2022/08/01/the-mechanism-behind-astringency-in-coffee/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=aeropress-championship-2025-lessons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://coffeeadastra.com/2022/08/01/the-mechanism-behind-astringency-in-coffee/</a></p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CafyJ2p0Bgs&utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=aeropress-championship-2025-lessons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CafyJ2p0Bgs</a></p></li></ul><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">That‚Äôs all I have.

  <title>Can Steel Ball make Coffee better?</title>

Hope you had a nice caffeinated week. </p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I recently saw an interesting pour-over setup at a cafe. Between the pour-over brewer and the coffee server, there was a holder. I was intrigued.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I asked the barista about it; he told me a cold steel ball goes in that holder while brewing, and it makes the coffee taste better.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The coffee we get isn&#39;t cold, but the cold ball is used in the first half of the brewing process to improve its taste.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I had to try it. But was it better?</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Before telling you how it tasted or felt, let me talk about the research this interesting brewer sparked.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/02d6d8a6-23ce-4125-9671-bcb18d2c7c53/Pasted_image_20250419161243.png?t=1745061565"/></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This brewer is called Paragon from the company named Nucleus coffee tools. They came up with a science technique called &quot;Extract Chilling.&quot;</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Let me boil down how it works.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Any experience, either food or a drink, involves not just the taste but also the smell or the aroma of that item.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">To test this, you can sip coffee with your nose pinched. It doesn&#39;t feel the same. Remember when you had a cold and your nose was all stuffed up? You probably noticed how bland the food tasted.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">And in coffee, there are a lot of volatile compounds that make up the aroma. If you take a cup of coffee, you can taste different notes at different temperatures because of this.</p><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Coming back to the brewer, the chilling rock plays a crucial role of locking in the volatile aroma compounds while brewing.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">First let&#39;s look at the brewing process without the chilling rock, and then go to how it makes the taste better.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This technique is primarily a pour-over.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Coffee extracts differently at different temperatures. Especially in a pour-over. When you pour hot water from above onto the coffee, first the acids and fats get extracted. Then the sweetness. By this time, the whole coffee reaches higher temperatures. And now the body and bitterness get extracted. When all of these are balanced well, the cup tastes good.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Now, when the coffee is beginning to extract, we let it drip over the chilling rock and lock in the aroma. This chilling rock is used in the zone when the acids and sweetness are extracted.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/8c1db280-291d-4287-9352-53d2084207be/24748.png?t=1745061653"/></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is known to lock in up to 40% more volatiles which otherwise are lost in the air. The aroma that fills the room while making coffee is captured with this.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Back to the question of whether the coffee tasted good ‚Äì it was a great cup of coffee in general. What I should have done is taste the coffee normally with out this chill ball and then with, to make out the difference.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Let me leave you with a few links where you can learn more about this.</p><ol start="1"><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://nucleuscoffeetools.com/news/understanding-the-paragon-and-its-scientific-approach/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=can-steel-ball-make-coffee-better" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Understanding the Paragon and its Scientific approach</a></p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFw2OjnB43c&utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=can-steel-ball-make-coffee-better" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Chill Extract Theory and Paragon Brewer</a></p></li></ol><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">It&#39;s fascinating how things in coffee are developed and invented.</p><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">That‚Äôs all I have.

Fascinating.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><i>I asked the Barista, &quot;How is this different from the regular V60?&quot;.</i> He said that this one has a faster run down rate.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">That means water doesn&#39;t stay with the coffee grounds for long.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">So he was making changes, like increasing agitation with more number of pours, to counter this run down rate. Or else we would have been left with an under extracted cup tasting weak and sour.</p><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Let us take a small detour to understand why.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><b>Different stages of the brewing extracts different components from the coffee.</b> First, when the coffee is getting wet with hot water, it&#39;s the acidic and the fatty components come out. Then the sweeter ones. And at last come the bitterness and boldness.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">When all of these are perfectly balanced, you get a good tasting cup. And depending on the coffee, you can tweak, balance and get a cup of your choice.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is the reason I like experimenting with pour overs, all the different brewers and the parameters. Same coffee but different tastes.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">With this gyaan, I hope you see and analyze coffee with a different lens.</p><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The cup ended up tasting sweet, well balanced and bodied.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Because it&#39;s in a cafe, they used 15g of coffee which is their standard dose. But one of the great advantages you get with this dripper is that you can brew coffee with as low as 6g as it&#39;s narrow and bed height wouldn&#39;t be so low.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/946524f8-4fae-4a77-82e3-2b871aea141e/28179.png?t=1743850988"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p><a class="link" href="https://cafec-jp.com/products/deep27/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=a-cheeky-little-coffee-dripper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://cafec-jp.com/products/deep27/</a></p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This only means you can micro dose caffeine through out the day. ;)</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">One more thing to keep in mind is that you would need a get filter papers that are designed specifically for this dripper. Cafec strongly suggests we don&#39;t use regular V60 papers with extra folds as it makes the base uneven and raising the angle to 30deg.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">So yes, this is what I have learnt after stumbling upon this coffee dripper at a cafe.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Would I buy it? Yes, it wouldn&#39;t hurt.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Would you get one? If you have tried it, I would love to know how your experience was.</p><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">That‚Äôs all I have. Have a caffeinated weekend.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">See you.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Keep on brewing!</p></div><div class='beehiiv__footer'><br class='beehiiv__footer__break'><hr class='beehiiv__footer__line'><a target="_blank" class="beehiiv__footer_link" style="text-align: center;" href="https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=4242a510-4cd3-433b-847a-a2487e5dc382&utm_medium=post_rss&utm_source=caffeineletter">Powered by beehiiv</a></div></div>

Once you start making it at home, it becomes very hard not to have it.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">You might have a great setup at home, but you can&#39;t travel around with all that. It becomes so cumbersome to pack everything.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0d6e3f09-9f56-448e-a028-45918df0ed57/IMG_4143.jpeg?t=1743162917"/><div class="image__source"><a class="image__source_link" href="https://www.altspaced.com/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=travel-coffee-setups" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span class="image__source_text"><p>Alt Space, Dharamshala</p></span></a></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I am at Dharamshala now and I packed an Aeropress, hand grinder along with some coffee beans. And I love this setup.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I spoke with my fellow travellers who happen to love coffee as well. This post is a distillation of all the practical options for a mobile coffee setup.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">And while you book stay for your travel, it is good to confirm that they have a water heating kettle. Most areas have it.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">For the coffee beans, I like freshly ground, so I carry a hand grinder. But you can take ground coffee if this is not something you are obsessed about.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I mainly talk about the setups for black coffee here but you can fancy a milk one with one of the espresso techniques.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="aeropress">Aeropress</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is hands down the best choice. I always carry this with me while travelling.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/171e642c-c4e0-4946-9ebe-4cd3327a2fa2/IMG_1474.jpeg?t=1743162770"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p>Aeropress-ing morning coffee from the hostel in Himalayas</p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Aeropress is good mainly because the setup is small to carry. The Aeropress itself, paper filters/metal filter, and coffee beans.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I recently learnt that you can also get an attachment to the Aeropress called <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/daHVyiUoRYw?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=travel-coffee-setups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Prismo</a> which opens up possibilities for an espresso.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/7d5b9354-75d6-4abf-a293-cbbb4b46e056/11818.png?t=1743162996"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p><a class="link" href="https://www.benkibrewingtools.com/products/fellow-aeropress-prismo?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=travel-coffee-setups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.benkibrewingtools.com/products/fellow-aeropress-prismo</a></p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">With this, you can have an espresso, Americano, or any milk based drinks.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="nanopress">Nanopress</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">On the slightly expensive side, we have Nanopress for around 6k INR. This works well for an espresso again.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/d1638db1-228c-48e4-84c8-650faf7f0cc2/68896.png?t=1743163031"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p><a class="link" href="https://www.benkibrewingtools.com/collections/wacaco/products/wacaco-nanopresso-espresso-coffeemaker?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=travel-coffee-setups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.benkibrewingtools.com/collections/wacaco/products/wacaco-nanopresso-espresso-coffeemaker</a></p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The way this works is you put in the ground coffee, hot water and pump the nob with you hand. The maximum pressure you can generate is 18 bars which is more than enough for an espresso.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Again, the possibilities are unlimited when you have an espresso at hand.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="easy-pour-bags">Easy Pour bags</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If you are into pour overs, this is a great option. You get these easy pour bags which put over a cup, pour hot water and enjoy the coffee.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">We talked about them in a <a class="link" href="https://letter.coffee/p/easiest-way-to-brew-speciality-coffee-at-home/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=travel-coffee-setups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">post</a> earlier and I have also mentioned a few options where you can buy from.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/18844bc0-1558-4f1f-8a4d-d04a3e2e6341/Lifestyle_4_bcc19eef-90f6-43ba-8ca2-c5571d31a385.jpeg?t=1743163075"/></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">A lot of the people here prefer this method. Especially as there is no major investment over any equipment.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If you are feeling fancy and experimental, you can get only the bags on amazon and fill it with your favourite coffee ground to perfection by you. Then you can carry them in any airtight container and you are good to go.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="last-resort">Last resort</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The last option is instant coffee, like Davidoff, Sleepy Owl, etc. I hate to mention it because I don&#39;t like it. But people do carry or buy instant coffee while travelling. So it gets to be here on this post.</p><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">So, what will be your travel companion. Let me know.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">That‚Äôs all I have.

I will cover which equipment to buy and which method to choose based on your preference for coffee.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Also - I will try to keep the costs low. If you haven&#39;t figured it out already, coffee is an expensive hobby, not because the equipment is pricey, but because there are so many ways you can make coffee, and once you start, you want to try them all.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I have been brewing coffee at home for over 5 years now. I grind my beans and make a cup every morning. So today I pen down thoughts and recommendations.</p><h2 class="heading" style="text-align:left;">Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="#what-do-you-prefer" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">What do you prefer?</a></p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="#mokapot" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Mokapot</a></p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="#french-press" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">French Press</a></p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="#aeropress" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Aeropress</a></p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="#pour-over" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Pour over</a></p></li></ul><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="what-do-you-prefer">What do you prefer?</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I will talk 4 ways to get started - mokapot, french press, aeropress and pour over, along with what equipment is needed.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is your guide to choosing which method to pick. If you -</p><ul><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Prefer it black: literally any method</p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Prefer with milk: Mokapot - Best. You can also experiment with French press and Aeropress to get concentrated coffee.</p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Want it quick: French press is your best bet</p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Appreciate all the characteristics of the beans: Pour over</p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Beginner-friendly but not too easy: Aeropress</p></li></ul><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><b>How do we get the beans?</b> The best is to buy whole beans and grind them just before you brew. You will need a grinder for this. Grinders are the costliest part of a home brewing setup. They should be. Getting a good one that gives you a consistent grind is crucial in brewing a good cup. We wrote about grind sizes and how to tweak them in the <a class="link" href="https://letter.coffee/p/grind-the-coffee-finer/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=so-you-want-to-brew-coffee-at-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Grind size</a> post.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">To begin with, you can buy ground beans based on the brewer you want to use.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">While going through the brewing methods below, I will <b>cover an overview</b> of each type and not get into the nuances - to avoid this post getting any longer. But I promise to cover all the details in future issues.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Regarding the equipment, having a <b>kitchen scale</b> handy helps immensely to get consistent cups. When you measure out how much coffee and water go in, it because easy to adjust and alter.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="mokapot">Mokapot</h3><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/7d37d173-b754-400e-aa88-21e7563db628/image.png?t=1742562681"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p><a class="link" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/grayscale-photo-of-a-kettle-yoj8OkC4hw0?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=so-you-want-to-brew-coffee-at-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://unsplash.com/photos/grayscale-photo-of-a-kettle-yoj8OkC4hw0</a></p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I would call this a wannabe espresso, popularly known as a stove-top espresso. This is best to drink as is if you are an espresso person. It suits well if you plan on adding milk. Or you can add more water to make it an Americano.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The coffee is espresso-like, strong and bold. Medium and dark roasts work well with this. Light roasts feel too sour sometimes.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><b>Equipment:</b> Mokapot and a stove/electric stove.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><b>How you brew:</b> Fill water (preferably hot) upto the valve, fill the basket with ground coffee, screw the lid and put the mokapot a stove on low heat.

Pour over method produces some fine coffee taking advantage of the complete flavour profile of the beans you use.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This method is definitely an art. There is some technique you should learn. But then, you can tweak almost every parameter in your technique like the pouring speed, agitation, height from which you pour and see the flavour of the coffee changing.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I love playing with these parameters.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><b>Equipment</b>: Pour over, filters (paper or cloth), and a gooseneck kettle.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If you observe, I mentioned the ‚Äúgooseneck‚Äù kettle. This is important as it controls the pour rate, a crucial part of your technique.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><b>How you brew:</b> Put the pour over on you cup or a coffee server, put the filter in it and rinse it with (preferably hot) water. Get rid of that water. Add your coffee, now pour water in circles on the coffee. We generally don‚Äôt pour all the water at once but do multiple pours and time them.</p><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I hope this helps in deciding which method to start with.

Let me tell you which one and why the excitement.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">You might have heard of Arabica. You might have also heard Robusta. These are the popular species of coffee that are well known and available everywhere.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">But there are two more recognized varieties of coffee: Liberica and Excelsa.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I tried <b>Excelsa</b>. It is not widely available. I was really surprised knowing few Indian Estates grow Excelsa. And <a class="link" href="https://rossettecoffee.com/products/excelsa-duo-yeast-inoculated-naturals-100g-anaerobic-naturals-200g?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=i-tried-an-exotic-coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Rosette coffee</a> and <a class="link" href="https://www.subko.coffee/products/specialty-excelsa-mooleh-manay-estate-coorg-karnataka-black-honey-medium-roast?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=i-tried-an-exotic-coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Subko</a> roast them and sell them.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I was researching on why this is becoming popular and why were they not in the first place. It&#39;s really interesting.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Arabica and Robusta are easier to grow. And easier to produce in large quantities. So exporters preferred them. They are also lower in height compared to Excelsa.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">But recently, there seems to be some supply chain disruption in countries like Brazil (droughts followed by heavy rains damaged crops) and Vietnam (extreme weather conditions). Hence the prices were raised. It led people to look for food alternatives.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The advantage with Excelsa and Liberica is they can grow in warmer temperatures and don&#39;t need much altitude. Coffee industry is also booming, especially speciality coffee. The demand for variety is increasing, leading to the popularity.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Interestingly, this variety is known to have less caffeine. Which only means one thing - drink more cups.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">That&#39;s the research and theory part. Let&#39;s get into the experience.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I ordered these Excelsa <a class="link" href="https://www.subko.coffee/products/specialty-excelsa-mooleh-manay-estate-coorg-karnataka-black-honey-medium-roast?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=i-tried-an-exotic-coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">beans from Subko</a>.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="border-radius:4px;" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/158e5da2-926c-4210-8176-13396b39a32b/IMG_4048.jpeg?t=1741945700"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p><a class="link" href="https://www.subko.coffee/products/specialty-excelsa-mooleh-manay-estate-coorg-karnataka-black-honey-medium-roast?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=i-tried-an-exotic-coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.subko.coffee/products/specialty-excelsa-mooleh-manay-estate-coorg-karnataka-black-honey-medium-roast</a></p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If you observe, the altitude is 1000 MASL (meters above sea level), which generally low. Most specialty coffee is typically grown between 1,200-2,000 MASL.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">On a side note, Mooley Manay Estate also grows Arabica and Robusta at this altitude. This estate is amongst the first farms in India to grow high grade Excelsa coffee.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="border-radius:4px;" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5b4e1aa6-1d6a-4e56-b751-e4ab472b890f/IMG_4050.jpeg?t=1741945720"/></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The beans are rounder in shape. These are known to have a fruity sweeter notes in general.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">When I grind the beans, jackfruit aroma is so prominent. I couldn&#39;t get any other notes.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I made a regular V60 with 15g coffee and 150g water at 90C. This is my baseline recipe. I make changes on how it turns out based on this.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I thought the jackfruit wouldn&#39;t transfer to the cup after brewing it but it did. This is a funky coffee. Everyone might not like it but for it turned out nice. Good balance which starts out sweet and has an acidic after finish.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is an interesting experience. I only had one cup till now. Will do more. Also the recommendation says it&#39;s best to use it up within 30 days. Looking forward to more funky brews.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/cdaaed21-9d41-466a-978f-674e1cddea45/IMG_4051.gif?t=1741946112"/></div><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">That‚Äôs all I have.

Is it the taste or is it how it makes you feel after you have it?</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">It&#39;s hard to choose one benefit over the other.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">It&#39;s the same with me. Sometimes I need it to make me feel good, and sometimes I get obsessed with perfecting my pour-overs.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">We can only consume coffee in a limit. On top of that, there are time restrictions. If I drink in the evening, I can&#39;t fall asleep. Even if you can fall asleep after a coffee, it&#39;s advised not to and even science backs it up.<a href="#b-8faa32d5-119f-4086-8ed5-6755fbda3b53" target="_self" title="1 https://www.perplexity.ai/search/why-should-you-not-have-coffee-dx9gMPiVRzaVku.gIqe9jA" data-skip-tracking="true"><sup style="-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;">1</sup></a></p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">But - What if there is coffee that <b>would not affect your sleep</b> and circadian rhythm?</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is where &quot;decaf&quot; comes into the picture.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Decaf stands for de-caffeination. It is the process where we remove the caffeine from coffee while (trying to) preserve its taste.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The downside is there won‚Äôt be any caffeine kick for obvious reasons.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="how-does-that-taste-even">How does that taste, even?</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Well, <b>I tried it</b>.

It&#39;s hard to describe. And I am sure you wouldn&#39;t even feel the difference if you have this with milk or with any other combo. I am just nitpicking here.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="talking-science">Talking Science.</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If you look at the packaging, it says &quot;Water Process&quot;. This led me to research how decaf coffee is made.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Removing caffeine while preserving flavor requires balancing chemistry, time, and resource investment. All methods begin with¬†<b>green (unroasted) coffee beans</b>, as roasting would lock in caffeine and alter flavor profiles.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">There are four primary decaffeination processes: <b>solvent-based</b>,¬†<b>Swiss Water</b>,¬†<b>CO‚ÇÇ</b>, and¬†<b>methylene chloride method</b>.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Talking about each in detail would be a lot for this post, so let me leave some links for you to explore. Now I will describe how my brain understands these.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Imagine you‚Äôre washing mud off a potato. If the mud were caffeine, here‚Äôs how each method works:</p><ol start="1"><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Solvent and Methylene Chloride Method:</span> Use soap (chemicals) to scrub off mud quickly. Cheap but leaves a tiny soap residue.</p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Swiss Water:</span> Soak the potato in mud-free water. The mud moves out, but it takes all day. (This is the one the I tried)</p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">CO‚ÇÇ Method:</span> Fancy pressure washers blast away mud without soap. Fast and clean but needs expensive equipment.</p></li></ol><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">These complex processes are the reasons behind the high price of decaf coffee.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="can-i-try">Can I try?</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I am glad India&#39;s coffee scene is growing.

I always thought it was. If I drink a lot of coffee in a day, I feel dehydrated and my lips become dry.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I researched and also came across a few other myths.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="myth-1-coffee-is-dehydrating">Myth 1 - Coffee is dehydrating</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Studies<a href="#b-12d58630-0851-47e9-ad0c-d45c980c221c" target="_self" title="1 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0084154" data-skip-tracking="true"><sup style="-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;">1</sup></a> have shown that coffee is not dehydrating, but it even contributes to the daily fluid intake.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">However, caffeine in coffee is known to be a diuretic, meaning it increases urine production. So you urinate a lot, making you dehydrated. We published a post on <a class="link" href="https://letter.coffee/p/how-much-coffee-is-too-much-coffee/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=does-coffee-dehydrate-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">caffeine and guesstimating caffeine content in coffees</a>. That should help you figure out how much caffeine is making you dehydrated.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">One more thing that I came across, irrelevant to dehydration, is that coffee depletes is your Magnesium (Mg) stores and the rate of Mg absorption in your body. While it is true that coffee disrupts sleep, Mg which is an important mineral that helps your muscles and body relax is gone, which makes it harder for you to sleep. No doubt supplementing Mg helped me fall asleep better.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="myth-2-coffee-is-addictive">Myth 2 - Coffee is addictive</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">As much as I want this to be a myth, it is only half myth.

You as well, {{ first name | friend }}?</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote__quote"></blockquote></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">But in a few studies, it is noted that caffeine withdrawal symptoms are as not bad as hard drugs.<a href="#b-99206c05-ef6d-4d4a-9638-33c3dee90b9d" target="_self" title="2 https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3777290/" data-skip-tracking="true"><sup style="-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;">2</sup></a> This much news is enough for me to call this a myth.

We talk about measuring the amount of caffeine in your coffee.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The amount of caffeine depends on the amount of coffee that was used to make the drink. For instance, a Cappuccino and an Americano have the same amount of caffeine even though Americano looks all black and strong.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">However, it highly varies on the brew methods. Filter coffees have high caffeine content compared to machine made espresso based ones.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="myth-4-black-coffee-is-a-fat-cutter">Myth 4 - Black Coffee is a fat cutter</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I get amazed by how many people think coffee cuts fat.

While we are obsessed with recipes, high-cost equipment like grinders, temperature-controlled kettles and so on, what is more important? Isn‚Äôt it the joy of drinking coffee?</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I recalled how my journey with coffee started. And what experiments it contained.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">It was during the pandemic era when I ordered a French press and Blue Tokai coffee beans. I ground them in a mixer and made myself a great cup of coffee. Surely the IKEA Effect was real.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote__quote"></blockquote></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">A year went by; I spent quite some time with the French press and had my own way of brewing with it. At some point, I was telling my friend about this carefully created process I was obsessed about. He laughed and said he would just drop ground coffee powder in boiling water, leaving it for sometime and he was good to go.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I tried that and it was not bad. That made me realize it doesn‚Äôt take much. We humans are good at complicating simple things.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">All that said, I have invested a lot in coffee over the years and made my daily coffee a very complex routine.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><i>I think, in the end, it‚Äôs about finding some hobby that you can happily waste your time on.</i></p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Coming back to <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=can-you-brew-coffee-without-a-coffee-brewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><i>jugaads</i></a> and experiments, I came across many.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">From using a fresh press to froth milk and make it ready for a cappuccino, to adding salt in your coffee to make it less bitter. Every time I come across such a <i>jugaad</i>, I get fascinated.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">One that I tried recently is to imitate a <a class="link" href="https://coffeechronicler.com/hario-switch/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=can-you-brew-coffee-without-a-coffee-brewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Hario Switch</a> without having one. I wanted to try immersion for the bloom and then a regular drip pour over. This is a perfect fit for a Hario Switch, but I didn‚Äôt have one. So for the bloom, I used a ceramic cup, then transferred it to a pour over afterwards. Isn‚Äôt this the same? You get a lot more control with the switch, I know, but this is a low-cost way to achieve what it does.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">It is these experiments that take the coffee culture forward.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I curated some more <i>jugaads</i> for you:</p><ul><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/46c4ej/what_are_your_favorite_coffee_hacks/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=can-you-brew-coffee-without-a-coffee-brewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">What are your favorite coffee hacks - r/Coffee</a></p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://youtube.com/shorts/050wpR08mi0?feature=shared&utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=can-you-brew-coffee-without-a-coffee-brewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Experiments with Coffee - YT Shorts</a></p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PUWQQ-joKE&utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=can-you-brew-coffee-without-a-coffee-brewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Magic of Salt in your Coffee - YouTube</a></p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7d-5KWHCU&utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=can-you-brew-coffee-without-a-coffee-brewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Coffee Hack: The Best Blade Grinder Results - YouTube</a></p></li></ul><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">And lastly, I want to leave you with this video where Lance tried the IKEA funnel to brew.</p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube_embed" frameborder="0" height="100%" src="https://youtube.com/embed/3bLmE6NTKmk" width="100%"></iframe><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">So {{ first name | friend }}, what is your favourite hack or what are you going to try next?

It sure is a investment as you will be spending more than ‚Çπ500. What if you don&#39;t like them?</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I have been there. Over the years, I have developed a set of guiding rules for myself while buying new coffee. These are what I will be penning down today.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">There are a few descriptors that we can look on almost all of the coffee bags. I will try to break down what they mean.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="taste-notes">Taste notes</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is probably the most important factor.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a46ff108-95e4-435f-af6d-6546f549982d/92619.png?t=1737722924"/></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">We have seen in the past issues that taste notes are not really straight forward. Those are the characteristics the cupper identifies while grading the coffee.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote__quote"></blockquote></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Identifying the notes and tasting your coffee is a skill in itself. We have a post addressing that - <a class="link" href="https://letter.coffee/p/developing-a-taste-for-your-coffee/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=choosing-your-next-coffee-beans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Developing a Taste for your Coffee</a>.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">What we can look for as a beginner is that is there is mention of fruits or berries, like pear, apple, cranberries etc, the coffee is going to be a little bright and sour. If they mention nuts or cocoa, it represents boldness and bitterness. Generally, it will be a mix of everything, and the note which is written first will be the most evident quality.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="grind-size">Grind size</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I highly recommend grinding your own coffee. We <a class="link" href="https://letter.coffee/p/grind-the-coffee-finer/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=choosing-your-next-coffee-beans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">talked about it earlier</a>. I have a grinder so I always buy whole beans.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If you don&#39;t have one yet, you can find the grind size for your brewing tool generally mention on the site while ordering.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="roast-profile">Roast Profile</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If you ask me, I would go with a light to medium roast. I wouldn&#39;t prefer dark as the method I use, which is a pour over, doesn&#39;t really bring that much on to the table. It tastes the same every time. Whereas with a light roast, I have so many variables to tweak and play with.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">You have to figure out what works for you depending on your equipment and taste.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Understanding the roast profile based on descriptors like light, medium and dark roast is straight forward. You know what you are getting.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">But some roasters don&#39;t mention this. Or they mention terms like filter roast, espresso roast or omni roast. These are abstracted terms for the brewing method you would use. Filter for all your manual brews, espresso for drinks that start with an espresso, and omni is for both filter and espresso and works across all brewers.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">‚Äî</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I feel these guiding factors are enough when you are forming your taste and figuring out what works for you.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Hope this helps in picking your next coffee beans.</p><hr class="content_break"><h2 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="from-the-coffeeverse">From the coffee-verse</h2><ul><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO4duW90-wY&utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=choosing-your-next-coffee-beans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">How I Mastered Coffee Tasting - My training protocol for Coffee Q-grading exams</a> - YouTube</p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://www.mehulved.com/post/open-secret-to-brewing-your-best-coffee?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=choosing-your-next-coffee-beans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Open Secret to Brewing Your Best Coffee</a> - Mehul Ved</p></li></ul><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">That‚Äôs all I have.

Hope you are doing great.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I do drink a hot black filter coffee daily. But more often than I&#39;d believe, I mix it up and make myself and my friends a nice coffee drink.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I want to talk about my two favourite coffee drinks.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">You would find these in any cafe, but we talk about how to make it at home from a home brewer&#39;s perspective.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Remember that these are cold drinks, where ice is the common ingredient. Most homes have ice cubes in the freezer; we use that. Sadly, I am lactose intolerant, so there is no milk involved.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><i>But I do drink it with milk sometimes. Don&#39;t hesitate to send me your recipes that involve milk.</i></p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">So, it is ice, the coffee base, and some mixers.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="the-base">The Base</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Yes, it&#39;s coffee. And it&#39;s the most important ingredient of the drink.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If it were at a cafe, pulling an espresso shot and making the drink would be easy. But you might not have that setup at home. I don&#39;t. So I experimented and found a way.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I have a Moka Pot at home. Coffee from that is similar to an espresso. I use that.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style="">Before owning a moka, I used to make it with a¬†</span><a class="link" href="https://letter.coffee/p/understanding-french-press/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=our-favourite-coffee-drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">French Press</a><span style="">¬†or an Aeropress.</span> 1:2 coffee-to-water ratio worked for me‚Äîone part of ground coffee beans to 2 parts of water. It needs to be this concentrated, or else it just becomes diluted. Make your regular brew with this ratio and you will be good.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Honestly, you can just mix some instant coffee in water and use that as the base. If you don&#39;t have any equipment yet, this is the way. But I don&#39;t like instant.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I like to look at the mixers in these drinks as something that compliments the complex flavors of coffee and makes the drink more enjoyable. Instant coffee has nothing other than bitterness. Once you start enjoying brewing <a class="link" href="https://letter.coffee/p/speciality-coffee?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=our-favourite-coffee-drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">specialty coffee</a>, there is no going back.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">After your base is ready, let it cool down and come to room temperature. You can add one ice cube and get it to cool down faster. But be careful not to dilute it too much.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="drink-1-cranberry-coffee">Drink 1 - Cranberry Coffee</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is a great drink that is sweet, refreshing, and energizing. The cranberry juice adds good sweetness and tangy-ness to the bitter coffee.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The ratio that I like is 30ml of coffee and around 150ml of cranberry juice. You can get the cranberry juice from any nearby mart; Tropicana works well.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Take around 50g of ice in a glass and add 150ml of cranberry juice. Slowly pour coffee over a slant spoon on the floating ice cube. That&#39;s how you can create a layer of coffee on top.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Honestly, this is just aesthetics, but isn&#39;t it fun?</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/3b08044b-d948-4107-a149-4d568a0ff9f7/D8A19868-0E8C-4FD0-B060-7BACC1B67D14_1_105_c.png?t=1737109075"/></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Here is a reference picture on how to layer coffee on top of a mixer.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/7759a047-8bfe-4373-bed1-21560b058102/IMG_3429.jpeg?t=1737109260"/></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">One more variation you can do is to reduce the cranberry juice to 100ml and add some sparkling water or soda. It cuts off sweetness and adds freshness to the drink. ‚ú®</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="drink-2-espresso-tonic">Drink 2 - Espresso Tonic</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Everything, except the mixer, from the above drink carries down to this drink.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Tonic water is a carbonated soft drink made with quinine. It has some unique bitterness and sourness with a sweet aftertaste. It&#39;s majorly enjoyed as a mixer with Gin. You might have heard of <i>Gin and Tonic</i>.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">We do it with coffee now.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Initially, I didn&#39;t enjoy making this. But after switching to better tonic water like Sepoy & Co, <a class="link" href="https://x.com/aravindballa/status/1870847141981405625?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=our-favourite-coffee-drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">thanks to Mehul</a>, I love it. These are sweeter than the Schweppes ones.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The ratios are mostly the same: 30ml coffee, 120ml tonic, and about 50g ice.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a9835f7a-7e38-41fd-bedd-e5de3f066071/29D1684E-29ED-4958-A45A-E200B95346B2_1_201_a.png?t=1737109306"/></div><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="bonus">Bonus</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Swap the cranberry juice with orange juice, and you get yourself an Espresso Sunrise.</p><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">That&#39;s all I have. I&#39;m curious - do you have a favorite coffee drink?</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">See you.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Keep on brewing!</p></div><div class='beehiiv__footer'><br class='beehiiv__footer__break'><hr class='beehiiv__footer__line'><a target="_blank" class="beehiiv__footer_link" style="text-align: center;" href="https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=a94bb1c1-e40b-4fc4-ac02-c98891361bf9&utm_medium=post_rss&utm_source=caffeineletter">Powered by beehiiv</a></div></div>

I can&#39;t take the complete blame for dumbness because caf√©s come up with fancy names for items and charge you more for it.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">In the workshop, which I mentioned in my previous posts, I actually came to know that coffee is graded. And a score above 80 makes it a &quot;speciality&quot; coffee.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Yes, it&#39;s like attending boards and getting an A grade, but for coffee ‚Äì the beans, the farmers who grew it, the roaster who roasted it and everyone involved.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="why-should-we-care-about-speciality">Why should we care about &quot;Speciality&quot; coffee?</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If you, <i>like me</i>, hate instant coffee, then you found your reason to care.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Instant coffee is mass produced. The quality of the bean is not checked. Companies buy lower quality beans in bulk for cheap, brew it in large amounts, flash freeze it, and then pack them into bottles and sell.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/d00222e5-336c-4909-bfc5-9bf8244cf167/20578.png?t=1736509744"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p><a class="link" href="https://perfectdailygrind.com/2020/08/the-rise-of-instant-coffee/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=let-s-talk-about-speciality-coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://perfectdailygrind.com/2020/08/the-rise-of-instant-coffee/</a></p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Well, there is nothing wrong in drinking this and there sure is an audience for it.

A global organization called <b>SCA</b> (Speciality Coffee Association) sets standards for specialty coffee at every stage of the coffee production, including allowable defects in green beans, water standards, and brew strength.

Espresso Martini), which is a cocktail that tasted like coffee <i>and also</i> got me tipsy.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">&quot;What a jackpot&quot;, I thought. It was very interesting.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Until then, I hadn&#39;t imagined the taste of coffee to be in anything other than a regular cup of morning coffee. I asked the bartender how it was made and he mentioned &quot;coffee liqueur&quot;.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I wasn&#39;t a coffee snob back then. I gradually forgot about that and went on with my life.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Recently, I was gifted this bottle of coffee liqueur, called <a class="link" href="https://www.quaffine.com/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=let-s-talk-about-tipsy-coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Quaffine</a>, which brought back those memories back and made me all jolly.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/2a772567-efc0-429c-9a05-b4afb91c3875/IMG_3003.jpeg?t=1735208108"/></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">It <b>tasted like a plum cake</b> with a nice coffee flavour, which might be because of the spices and butter it has got.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I loved drinking this coffee liqueur, just neat-ly topped with ice. I also tried mixing it. My favourite mixer was plain tonic water. It balanced the coffee flavours and the sourness shockingly well.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If you&#39;ve ever had espresso tonic, this is a better (alcoholic) version of that.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="lets-talk-some-history">Let&#39;s talk some History</h3><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote__quote"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">A liqueur (UK: /l…™Ààkj ä…ôr/ li-KURE, US: /l…™Ààk…úÀêr/ li-KUR) is an alcoholic drink composed of spirits (often rectified spirit) and additional flavorings such as sugar, fruits, herbs, and spices.

  <title>Can Coffee taste like a Mango</title>
  <description>I got to try a wildly different set of beans recently and that pushed me in to knowing a bit about post processing of the coffee.</description>

Hope this week has been good and you were decently caffeinated throughout.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I had an absolute blast of coffee having at least two cups a day this week. <i>I probably have to dial down a bit on caffeine next week.</i></p><hr class="content_break"><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Recently, a friend of mine, while coming from UK, helped me get hold of these coffee beans. On the pack, the taste notes said ‚Äúpassion fruit‚Äù and ‚Äúmango‚Äù. <i>I was like</i>¬†<i>pfft...., these guys say too much.</i></p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/9ac2193f-bccd-487c-8ccd-ff574d841fe6/IMG_2949_1.jpeg?t=1734776752"/></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">When I opened the pack and started grinding these, was shocked with a strong aroma of mango. It clearly stood out. I got very excited.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I brewed my regular V60 pour over, which is how I start any new bag of coffee with, and the mango clearly shined. It was more like mango bite chocolate. It was as if you mix a mango slush into the coffee after you brew it.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I was curious to know how this was possible. Because these fruit notes are not something you find typically in coffee. I though they might have stored the coffee beans along with cut pieces of mango which would have absorbed the taste.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><i>Well, I was partially right.</i></p><h2 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="fermentation-of-coffee">Fermentation of Coffee</h2><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">It turns out, after coffee is <a class="link" href="https://letter.coffee/p/what-does-honey-processed-mean?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=can-coffee-taste-like-a-mango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">processed</a> (which we talked about in the last email), in a few methods, they ferment it before drying it out.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">There are different use cases for coffee fermentation.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">One of the major use case is during the washed process. We know that here, coffee beans are de-pulped and the mucilage is removed before drying them out. In this specific step of removing the mucilage, it needs lots of water, energy etc. So instead, if you put the <b>de-pulped beans in citric acid for about 30 minutes, it breaks down the mucilage</b>.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Yeast is also used sometimes. It‚Äôs called anaerobic processed coffee.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><i>On to the interesting part now...</i></p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><b>Co-fermentation</b> - this is where you add fruits / fruit juice to the mix while fermenting the coffee, which imparts those flavours on to the beans.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ec7daf4b-b4b6-4bca-8d90-9d9982417408/30620.png?t=1734776908"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p>Source: <a class="link" href="https://perfectdailygrind.com/2024/09/infused-coffee-world-barista-championship/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=can-coffee-taste-like-a-mango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://perfectdailygrind.com/2024/09/infused-coffee-world-barista-championship/</a></p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Isn&#39;t this crazy!

How has this week been? Vikra and I are traveling this week, but don‚Äôt worry, we have an Aeropress with us.</p><hr class="content_break"><h2 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="understanding-process-label-on-coff">Understanding &quot;process&quot; label on coffee bags</h2><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I still remember looking at the coffee bags in my initial days of brewing coffee at home and wondering what &quot;honey processed&quot; label on it mean. I thought the beans were <i>marinated</i> in honey. If not anything, I expected the cup to have notes of honey.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Soon, I realized that&#39;s not the case. I learnt a thing about how coffee is processed. And its quite interesting.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="coffee-processing-and-its-affect-on">Coffee processing and its affect on the taste</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Coffee begins as a cherry-like fruit. Processing is simply how we get from that fresh fruit to the green beans (which then are roasted to become brown). They eventually become your morning brew. Think of it like how wine-making transforms grapes into complex wines.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is how the cross section of the coffee fruit. This will be a good reference when we talk about the different processing methods, <i>especially the mucilage</i>.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/78ea65f7-7fe3-4473-9329-eaecbb7ce6d5/19786.png?t=1734084124"/></div><h4 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="natural">Natural</h4><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is most obvious and basic way where the <b>whole coffee fruit is dried</b>. Mucilage and the pulp dry with the seed and latch on to it. This will develop complex flavours and make them sweeter. When these beans with lot of content on them are roasted, they go through a nice <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=what-does-honey-processed-mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">maillard reaction</a>, which is a common process in cooking, that results in unique flavours.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0e5acc75-0f58-49ff-89f5-c86770e82c0a/IMG_2924.jpeg?t=1734084162"/></div><h4 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="washed">Washed</h4><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">As you might have guess now, the bean is <b>washed before drying</b> here in washed processing. However, they pick nicely ripe coffee fruits to maintain the sweetness. These are put in de-pulper machines which leave the beans mucilage and remove up to the pulp layer. Then it is water washed to remove everything else until the seed.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This is generally quicker than the other methods but a lot of natural resources like water are wasted in this method.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">These coffees are generally light bodied, and have more brightness.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/3907d49c-3c13-4cb9-8c5b-974c07a420f9/IMG_2925.jpeg?t=1734084193"/></div><h4 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="honey">Honey</h4><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><i>Coming to my earlier disappointment</i>, there is no honey involved.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Honey processed coffee is a method that involves a combination of both the natural and washed methods. You can think of it as the best of both the worlds.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">They remove the pulp but not the mucilage from the coffee fruit. That mucilage is the honey!</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The flavours that these cups give are unique. Cleaner bodies than naturals and more syrupy sweetness than the washed.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/e7362918-1448-46d0-b1cb-9be7d87324a0/IMG_2926.jpeg?t=1734084201"/></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Not just these three but these are the major ones. There also a fermentation step that people do which is a topic in itself.</p><h3 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="which-one-do-you-think-you-like">Which one do you think you like?</h3><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Despite knowing all the theory and forming a bias into which one you will like, its complete experience in itself tasting them and figuring out which one you like.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I recommend you parallelly try them out and see.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">You can go to cafe and see if they have beans with different processes and order two cups.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Or, there are a few roaster that let you order a sample pack of three different smaller coffee beans. You can choose different processings there and try at home.</p><ul><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://bloomcoffeeroasters.in/products/bcr-custom-sample-pack-of-3?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=what-does-honey-processed-mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://bloomcoffeeroasters.in/products/bcr-custom-sample-pack-of-3</a></p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://halflightcoffee.com/products/specialty-coffee-sampler-pack?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=what-does-honey-processed-mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://halflightcoffee.com/products/specialty-coffee-sampler-pack</a></p></li><li><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://kcroasters.com/collections/taster-packs?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=what-does-honey-processed-mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://kcroasters.com/collections/taster-packs</a></p></li></ul><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">You can google and find that there more than these options.</p><hr class="content_break"><h2 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="whats-brewing-this-week">Whats brewing this week</h2><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">A lot actually.</p><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>December looks set!

Do you?</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I too had a favourite one. The reason being coffee tasted, or I should say drinking from it, felt wonderful.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I got yet another cup last week.</p><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>New fav cup</p></p><a href="https://twitter.com/aravindballa/status/1861034029656760775?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=do-you-have-a-favourite-cup"><p> &mdash; Aravind Balla (@aravindballa) <br/> 1:07 PM ‚Ä¢ Nov 25, 2024 </p></a></blockquote><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I was curious to know why. And not after long, I found myself in another rabbit hole. There is science which suggests that the vessel you drink from plays a surprising role in how you perceive your coffee&#39;s taste.</p><hr class="content_break"><h2 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="why-does-coffee-taste-different-in-">Why does coffee taste different in different cups</h2><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Eating or drinking is not just how your tongue interprets it, but a complete sensory experience. Which means it&#39;s not just your taste buds, but also the smell, sight, touch and even our subconscious expectations that affect the experience.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The smell makes up for more than half of the experience.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote__quote"></blockquote></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">We feel we can&#39;t taste food when we catch cold. Wondered why? That&#39;s because our smell is blocked. You can test this for yourself if close your nose and eat something.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">And this is the reason behind using same cups while cupping coffee, which is a standard protocol to grade coffee, worldwide.</p><h2 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="what-does-the-research-say">What does the research say</h2><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I brewed some coffee and poured it into 2 different cups. I was fascinated to observe that a heavy black ceramic cup made me feel that the coffee was bold and robust. While another was light transparent cup made tasted brighter. However, as I kept sipping both became almost similar, maybe because I knew the coffees were same and my brain then calibrated to that.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Here are the key differences summarized from the notes I took while researching.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><b>Color</b>: White cups tend to amplify the perceived intensity of coffee&#39;s flavor compared to transparent mugs. This might be due to the contrast between the dark coffee and the bright white interior, which primes our brain to expect a more robust taste. Blue and clear cups, on the other hand, often lead to perceiving coffee as smoother and less intense.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><b>Shape</b>: The cup&#39;s shape influences more than just how we hold it. Taller, narrower cups tend to concentrate aromatics, enhancing our perception of floral and fruity notes. Wider cups, with their larger surface area, can emphasize chocolate and nutty undertones by allowing more oxygen to interact with the coffee.</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><b>Touch</b>: The texture and weight of your cup add another layer to the experience. Heavy cups often make us perceive coffee as richer and more substantial, while lighter cups might lead us to focus more on the brighter, acidic notes.</p><h2 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="things-to-explore">Things to explore</h2><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If you are looking to expand your already big collection of coffee cups, I highly recommend the Aroma series of cups that Origami came up with. The cup I bought last week is an &quot;Aroma&quot; cup from the series.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/b257fdfa-a568-4ac7-a35f-c7d2ad9e30ea/image.png?t=1733567021"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p><a class="link" href="https://brewmethods.com.au/blogs/product-feature/origami-flavour-cups?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=do-you-have-a-favourite-cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://brewmethods.com.au/blogs/product-feature/origami-flavour-cups</a></p></span></div></div><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Here is some more info about those cups.</p><div class="image"><img alt="" class="image__image" style="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/caf99ed7-a832-4d3f-a3cb-6b2727c80b33/99976.png?t=1733567005"/><div class="image__source"><span class="image__source_text"><p><a class="link" href="https://origami-kai.com/en/products/origami-pinotflavorcup?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=do-you-have-a-favourite-cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://origami-kai.com/en/products/origami-pinotflavorcup</a></p></span></div></div><hr class="content_break"><h2 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="from-the-coffeeverse">From the coffee-verse</h2><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVKabsudi1I&utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=do-you-have-a-favourite-cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Charles Spence: Multisensory Experience and Coffee</a> - YouTube</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/s/AhUWzalaUc?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=do-you-have-a-favourite-cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Best Coffee in 2024</a> - r/CoffeeIndia</p><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><a class="link" href="https://dailycoffeenews.com/2024/12/04/a-cell-cultured-coffee-movement-is-rapidly-advancing/?utm_source=caffeineletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=do-you-have-a-favourite-cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">A Cell-Cultured Coffee Movement is Rapidly Advancing</a> - dailycoffeenews.com</p><hr class="content_break"><h2 class="heading" style="text-align:left;" id="whats-brewing-this-week">Whats brewing this week</h2><p class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">This week I was bidding goodbye to the medium roasted coffee beans, Baba Budangiri from Third Wave Coffee.
